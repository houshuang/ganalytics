## Purpose
I am in the process of learning R, and I wanted a challenge, so I am going to experiment with combining
Google Analytics data, and content data from my WordPress blog, and doing some exploratory data analysis/
visualization. 

I first need to get a hold of the data, and then begin playing with it. I will probably use ddply quite a bit,
for some of the more advanced stuff I'll need to study up on timeseries analysis.

## Log: Feb 14

So far, I have managed to download all the Google Analytics statistics (I think, have not validated that I got 
all the data). It was surprisingly difficult, dealing with OAuth2.
