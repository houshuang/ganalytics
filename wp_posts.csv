Sharing Knowledge with Developing Countries,"development,economics,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2004/09/26/sharing-knowledge-with-developing-countries/,"<p>While playing with the <a href=""http://www.utoronto.ca"">University of Toronto</a>&#8217;s <a href=""http://library.utoronto.ca"">library pages</a>, I did some random searches and came across an article about <a href=""https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/retrieve/3874/chan_costa.pdf"">&#8220;Participation in the global knowledge commons&#8221;</a> by Leslie Chan and Sely Costa. First of all, this is an example of how digitalizing academic publishing, and making it accessible for free-text searches makes knowledge more available (quite obvious, this piece has not even been published, but even if it had, in say <a href=""http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/carfax/01436597.html"">Third World Quarterly</a>, it is not likely that I would have come over it.)</p><p>Most peer-reviewed journal articles are now archived online in huge database repositories, which typically cost a lot to access (if you are at a university, you&#8217;ll never even notice this, because your university library probably has a site-wide license - however, they pay large amounts for this privilege). This article discusses some attempts by the <a href=""http://www.un.org"">UN</a> (<a href=""http://www.who.int/en"">WHO</a>)  and the <a href=""http://www.soros.org"">Soros Foundation</a> to enable libraries and non-profit organizations in poor countries to access these databases. It argues that while these attempts are certainly laudable, the ideal solution would be twofold. Firstly, moving towards public author archiving of all published articles, making them available for no fee at all, and secondly improving communications and information sharing between third world nations (studies done in similar contexts, let&#8217;s say of poor countries coping with AIDS epidemics, might be more useful then say studies of expensive drug treatments that are unavailable in third world countries).</p><p>It also cites the <a href=""http://www.plos.org"">Public Library of Science</a>, a newly started organization that publishes open peer-reviewed journals in both biology and medicine (more to come?), and which excited me a lot when I heard about it. It probably differs a lot from field to field, and journal to journal, but when working at <a href=""http://www.prio.no"">PRIO</a>, I learnt that for the <a href=""http://www.prio.no/page/Project_detail/Research_menu_right/9244/37834.html"">Journal of Peace Research</a>, nobody except the publishers really made any money off it (the editor, the peer-reviewers etc are all paid by their respective institutions), so it would seem to make a lot of sense to make it available publically?</p><p>Stian</p>","cheritycall => How are you?, Do something for help the hungry people in Africa and India, I made this blog about this subject: at <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/5t2jg6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/5t2jg6 </a>.

Originally it was meant to be banned, but somehow the book, which is hugely critical of the communist party - but mostly the power-abusive local cadres in rural villages - made it out in the book stands. Probably it was local maneuvring by progressive factions of the communist party which managed to get it published, and thereby secure some leverage (the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party"">CCP</a> is highly factionalized and interesting things can come out of this fact). However, as <a href=""http://pekingduck.org/"">Peking Duck</a> and <a href=""http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/03/1078295446788.html?oneclick=true"">the Age</a> points out, it was later <a href=""http://pekingduck.org/archives/001076.php"">banned again</a>, before the <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2002/china_party_congress/default.stm"">Party Congress</a>.</p><p>I actually did a paper on this book, which was my final project for Chinese at <a href=""http://www.lu.se"">Lund University</a>, where I discussed whether the book was an attack on the communist party in itself, or just &#8220;rotten&#8221; corrupt parts of it (and came to the conclusion that it was mostly the latter). Anyhow, the book has become quite well known in China, the full text is available in China from a number of bulletin boards (like <a href=""http://www.tylf.net/sannong/nongmin.html"">here</a>).

I thought others might be interested, so here are the major pathways into the UN system, as far as I can ascertain (this information is provided &#8220;as is&#8221;).</p><li><b>Internships:</b> Most of the UN organizations provide internships, although most of them are available to MA students only. Usually they are not remunerated, and you will have to find your own funding. Some organizations search for specific interns, whereas at others, you must fill out an online form for a database, from which interns matching certain criteria will be selected.</li><li><b><a href=""http://www.jposc.org/html/ie.html"">JPO programme</a></b>: The Junior Professional Officer programme is aimed at graduates with a bachelor or master degree. It does not require extensive work experience, and is designed to familiarize the applicant with the UN system. Application is through the home government of a participating nation, and the programme is financed by the home country. The applicant is either placed in a field-mission, or less often at the central office, for a duration of two to three years. Depending on outcome, a second placement of two to three years is possible. At the end, only very exceptional participants gain final  employment with the UN - the programme is also designed to train people to cooperate with the UN in international NGOs or home governments.</li><li><b><a href=""http://www.un.org/Depts/OHRM/examin/welcome.htm"">Competitive exams:</a></b> UN personell at levels <a href=""http://www.un.org/Depts/OHRM/examin/p2.htm"">P-2</a> and P-3 are mainly recruited through competitive exams, which are held once a year in selected countries (depending on which nationalities are currently needed to achieve a balance in the system). Examinees must have a relevant bachelor or masters degree (students with a degree in International Development Studies are eligible to take the exam for <a href=""http://www.un.org/Depts/OHRM/examin/p2socjd.htm"">Social Affairs</a>. See a <a href=""http://www.un.org/Depts/OHRM/examin/p2socsam.htm"">sample exam</a>.). Select candidates are then invited for an interview. <i>(Interestingly, this system reminds me quite a lot of the <a href=""http://www.csupomona.edu/~plin/ls201/confucian3.html"">imperial exam system</a> in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China"">dynastic China</a>.)</i></li><li><b><a href=""https://jobs.un.org/release1/vacancy/vacancy.asp"">Direct entry:</a></b> Some positions at the P-3 level, and all at levels above, are filled either by external search, or internal promotion. Anyone can apply for these positions, but usually a relevant university degree plus at least six years of working experience is required.<p>Good luck! :~)</p><p>Stian</li>","john => thanks stian, this was very helpful_ .

Whenever my mother didn&#8217;t know where I was, she would call the kind librarians at <a href=""http://www.hamar.kommune.no/hamar/www/site/forsiden/bibliotek/category.php?categoryID=312"">Hamar Public Library</a> (<a href=""http://hamar.clickwalk.no/images/hamar/1/1/6l.jpg"">the white building</a>), and they&#8217;d usually found me in a comfortable couch reading a book.

It basically works like this: you browse a selection of digital audiobooks online, choose a few that you&#8217;d like to listen to, and take the list to the librarian. He/she quickly downloads the files to an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp3"">mp3-player</a>, and hands it to you. Bike home, mow the lawn, cook - all while listening to your audiobook. Within minutes of your &#8220;handing them in&#8221; at your library, they become available to users at other participating libraries (yes, only one user can check out the same book simultaneously). They are appearantly working on making it work with patrons&#8217; own mp3-players. </p><p>It&#8217;ll be exciting to see what other ideas and projects can come out of libraries as they meet the dual threats/opportunities of emerging techonology - will libraries be reduced to mere internet cafes for the masses (already an important project to increase access), or will they add new and exciting services that we haven&#8217;t even started to think up?

WUSC subsequently tried to get the government of Ghana interested in taking over the project, and had at first received a very positive response, although run into a lot of practical difficulties, from which the speaker drew some &#8220;lessons&#8221; presented to us. However, I found the concept of going to a third world country, starting a project, and then having it integrated into the state sector, with the government paying for it, was a very interesting case of first world (NGO) influence on third world policy. </p><p>It reminds me of the <a href=""http://www.rockfound.org/display.asp?Context=1&#038;Collection=1&#038;Preview=0&#038;ARCurrent=1"">Rockefeller Foundation</a>&#8217;s work in <a href=""http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"">Mexico</a>, and other countries, where they would only finance 10-20% of a programme&#8217;s cost, but still remain in control of the policy - thus gaining strong leverage on a developing country&#8217;s agenda, with a relatively small financial outlay.

(Actually, I read Mastering the Machine, and then leafed through MTM Revisited to see if anything was new.) It is produced by a foundation set up by E. F. Schumacher, which works with appropriate technology in developing countries. The author seemed to have a good sensitivity for what appropriate technologies work and which do not. He gives a lot of examples of practical problems and solutions, many of them none to inspiring. NGOs and official development agencies are criticized for being to idealistic, scorning commercial cooperation (be it local or in the West), and not listening enough to local people. Sometimes appropriate technology might be big, sometimes it might be small. The theory of technology transfer is criticized, especially if that means transplanting a factory into the middle of the desert.

Now, <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4542783.stm"">things are stirring in Uzbekistan</a> as well, and it&#8217;s coming from a city that is right across from Osh, where the Kyrgyz revolution started. If I were Karimov, I would be worried. Of course, Western governments are worried as well - this is an Islamic uprising, and if they did indeed manage to oust Karimov, their rule would be more religious than the previous (kind of what is happening in Iraq). However, it seems that Western governments if slowly realizing that a democratically elected and accountable Islamic party, like in Turkey, might be preferable to a unpopular foreign-supported dictator.

I&#8217;ve seen a few other movies where they use &#8220;innovative&#8221; (maybe it once was) techniques of jumping to and from in times (<strong>Memento</strong> comes to mind as a very good example), others were characters struggle with loss of memory, alternate dimensions, thinking they are going crazy - and the viewer doesn&#8217;t know which version is &#8220;real&#8221; (<strong>A Beautiful Mind</strong> is a good example). Oh, let&#8217;s not forget the seminal <strong>Sliding Doors</strong>, which illustrated nicely &#8220;what might have happened&#8221;. It was a nice movie though, and raised some philosophical questions. Fate and all that. (What might have happened if I had missed that train going to Oslo for my interview for my <a href=""http://www.uwcad.it"">United World College</a>, back in 1998? Would I be in Mexico right now?) Simple conclusion: Tiny events can have huge repercussions (The Butterfly Effect, if I remember correctly, posits that a butterfly flapping it&#8217;s wings in America can make it rain in China). However, it&#8217;s impossible to calculate what the consequences would be (as we see in this movie, where everything he does ends up by making things worse). Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have been in Mexico if I had missed that train, but would I have been any worse off? Impossible to say. A good reason not to regret things.</p><p>On a different note, I just started listening to the classical novel &#8220;<strong>Hunger</strong>&#8221; (Sult) by <a href=""http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/khamsun.htm"">Knut Hamsun</a>. It&#8217;s a real classic, but I haven&#8217;t read many of the Norwegian classics (I am glad they didn&#8217;t force us to read much in school though, I might not have wanted to read them now). I am listening to a radio recording (published on CD, borrowed at my local library in Hamar, transferred to my MP3 and stored until now - when can I download this in public domain? I mean it was produced for the free tax-payer supported <a href=""http://www.nrk.no"">public broadcasting in Norway</a>). So far, I quite like it. It also talks a lot about Oslo, it&#8217;s streets and houses, and I always like &#8220;place-bound&#8221; books. It&#8217;s fun, since I&#8217;ve lived there myself. I want to find some books like this about Toronto.</p><p>Finally, I am going to Mexico city tomorrow morning. Slightly apprehensive, because it&#8217;s a monster of a city (20 million people, only about 5 times my country), but excited to be seeing more of Mexico, and to see my friend whom I haven&#8217;t seen in half a year. (Of course, among my good friends, half a year counts as short time. Unfortunately.) I will be living quite near <a href=""http://www.unam.mx/"">UNAM</a> (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México), which is possibly the largest university in the world - they have 270,000 students! And 30,000 professors. Even though a percentage of these are actually high-school students, since the university also runs some high schools (as I understand), it&#8217;s still impressive. They are the only Latin American university to rank on a <a href=""http://www.epfl.ch/soc/etudes/pdf/world-rankingsUnis.pdf"">top-50 list of world universities</a> (upz, PDF), of course these ratings don&#8217;t mean much, but still.

Since the individual lights did not work, I could not read after sunset (around 8PM), and had plenty of time to think (after my brain had been toasted with the movie Alexander the Great on full volume).<br /><img src=""http://www.metrokc.gov/kcdot/kids/transit/art/trolley.jpg"" alt=""Trolley bus"" align=right width=200 height=200/><br />Always trying to travel cheaply, and preferring overland for many reasons, I&#8217;ve spent quite a bit of time in buses and trains, in many countries. You come across a number of ingenious designs, and others not so smart - and you wonder, how does this kind of innovation happen, and spread? Why do they have trolley buses (electric buses, kind of a mix between buses and trams) in Eastern Europe and Russia, but not in Western Europe (that I know of)? In China, most long-distance buses are sleeper buses, with beds (see picture). Properly designed, they can probably carry almost as many people as a normal bus (in which nobody is standing), and they are much more comfortable for a long night. <a href=http://www.orchiddesigns.net/Assets/images/China2004/Sleeper%20bus%20interior%201633.jpg><img src=""http://www.orchiddesigns.net/Assets/images/China2004/Sleeper%20bus%20interior%201633.jpg"" alt=""Sleeper buses"" / width=200 height=200 align=right/></a></p><p>The interesting thing from an economical point of view, is that I would love to pay 10$-20$ extra for a night in one of these, instead of in a normal bus - but I don&#8217;t have that choice. And how is my economical choice registered in the market if the alternative does not exist? </p><p>Another ingenious solution that I came across once, on my way from Slovenia to Sweden on a bus where everybody but I spoke Serbo-Croat, where seats that fold into &#8220;beds&#8221;. The part of the seat that you sit on folds out to cover the entire space, and the back is turned up to cover the entire space above - thus you have two layers of beds, and since each person will &#8220;lay across two seats&#8221;, you can fit exactly as many people as you could when they were sitting. Surely it is kind of cramped, you might be forced to be intimate with someone you don&#8217;t know (needless to say there is no undressing going on), but still the opportunity to lay down and stretch out is far superior to trying to find a comfortable situation in a normal bus.</p><p>Or look at the super-long buses going through dedicated bus lanes in Brazil?

"Coding in Ruby,"opensource,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/06/16/coding-in-ruby/,"<p>This last week I have been working unusually hard. After fighting for a while with <a href=""http://www.ez.no"">EZPublish</a>, which is what <a href=""http://politicsofhealth.org"">Politics of Health</a> is published with, I have decided to try to migrate the whole system to a wiki. The article structure is very simple, we hardly use any of the CMS features of EZPublish, and it&#8217;s a beast. I know a lot of people use it, but personally there are fare too many files, php templates and directories for me to even begin to root around with. I spent a lot of time with a Norwegian CMS called <a href=""http://www.infofab.no"">InfoLab</a> (not opensource), which was quite nice. It lacked documentation, but at least all the modifications were done inside the program. With EZ, you have a bunch of stuff that is edited within the web-app, and other things (especially layout - but for changing anything except adding another identical article, you need to muck around with php). And it seems poorly documented at that level as well.</p><p>So I am trying to migrate us over to <a href=""http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki"">DokuWiki</a> (just a test, if it doesn&#8217;t do what we want, it should be easy to port it to another wiki). I am using <a href=""http://www.ruby-lang.org"">Ruby</a>, and after looking at the <a href=""http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL"">SQL database</a> of EZPublish, I decided to go straight to the HTML - which, since it is all outputted by a computer, is wonderfully predictable. I am using a combination of wget, <a href=""http://tidy.sourceforge.net"">Tidy</a> (with -asxhtml), <a href=""www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/"">REXML</a> (which is absurdly undocumented - it seems to work, but I don&#8217;t know why), and a bunch of regexps. The work is going slowly, mostly because it has been ages since I programmed in Ruby, and even then I never properly learnt it, so I have to look up most functions. But I learn quickly, Google is my friend, and I love Ruby. (If you are interested, and don&#8217;t know much about programming, may I suggest <a href=""http://www.poignantguide.net/ruby/"">the Poignant Guide to Ruby</a>?)</p><p><a href=""http://www.rubyonrails.org/"">Ruby on Rails</a> has garnered a lot of interest lately, with the first major book <a href=""http://books.slashdot.org/books/05/06/16/1914251.shtml"">selling over a 1000 copies of the prerelase PDF</a>. I didn&#8217;t know much about this before, but I read up on it a bit (a nice tutorial), and I must say I am impressed. This is quite different from mucking around with php and MySql. In general, although I&#8217;ve been working long days lately (including some network installing down in Mazatlan), I&#8217;ve enjoyed getting back into coding (after many years). I might continue doing it, if I can keep it at a regular but not overpowering level. There are some pretty neat ruby opensource projects, for example <a href=""http://www.instiki.org"">instiki</a> - a wiki with its own webserver - maybe I&#8217;ll try contributing to some of those (I could use <a href=""http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2005/05/10/trying-out-dokuwiki-and-wiki-wishlist/"">these wiki ideas </a>as a starter).</p><p>Stian</p>","GMaps, buses, open apis","opensource,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/06/30/gmaps-buses-open-apis/,"<p>It´s already been noted by for exampel Google and Flickr that opening up your api (the interface to your website) and allowing other programmes / webpages to interact with your data can be hugely positive in creating a community, that can come up with ideas that you never dreamt of.

In addition to doing a group project, we each had to write a paper about a topic that we could choose ourselves. I chose to pick up on the primary health care movement that we had learnt about in first semester (if the words &#8220;Alma Ata, 1978&#8243; do not mean anything to you, you could do a lot worse than browsing through Questioning the Solution, by David Werner, also available <a href=""http://www.healthwrights.org/books/QTSonline.htm"">for free online</a>), and focus on the Barefoot Doctors movement in China.</p><p>I don&#8217;t think I have worked so hard on a paper since I wrote my Extended Essay for <a href=""http://www.uwcad.it"">UWC</a> in Italy; this is of course only a measure of my effort, and not of the resulting quality.

Friends dying.</p><p>In a way, this movie is similar to many others,  <a href=""http://www.mgm.com/ua/hotelrwanda/intro.html"">Hotel Rwanda</a> being one of the last one. As much as it hurts watching these movies, I think they have a useful effect on me. They shake me. Make me remember the suffering in the world.

A study of international development is a study of errors and mistakes. And then there is the huge error in believing that only by being in the frontline, can you make a difference. By being a Blue Beret with the UN, or flying in to refugee camps with the UN helicopter delivering AID. Maybe working on intercultural education programmes, on antiwar and fair-trade projects in Western countries, on small grassroots-based development programmes is not as sexy. But my egoism and my sense of heroism is not what is important here, what matters is building a foundation for something lasting.

We arrived in Tijuana early in the morning.</p><p><strong>Border crossing:</strong><br />I actually thought there would be an hour of desert driving between Tijuana and San Diego, but they are completely adjacent. I tried walking to the border post, but they sent me back to the house where all the Mexicans were waiting for their visas. We stood in the scorching sun for about three hours (would it be that hard to put some shades out?), and then they let me in. The officer was very aggressive, claiming that I had overstaid my visa in the US (they gave me 3 months when I was flying through Los Angeles on my way to Mexico, and they never registered me leaving). He asked me a lot of questions, and talked to his boss. In the end they let me through.</p><p><strong>San Diego:</strong><br />The contrast between San Diego and Mexico is big, especially since all it takes to get there is walking across a bridge. For the first few hours I kept speaking Spanish to all the shopkeepers, and they all answered me in Spanish without problems. I left my luggage at the Greyhound station, bought my 45 day unlimited ticket for $550 (they wouldn&#8217;t give me the student discount, even though the webpage says I should be eligible). It was the first time they had sold that pass, and the manager had to come out with the instruction booklet.</p><p>I took a trolley down to San Diego downtown, walked around for a few hours, had a huge meal of fried noodles, saw the pier&#8230; San Diego is a very nice city, clean, spacious, nice buildings, warm weather, on the sea. But it&#8217;s weird - it kind of feels like a museum or Disneyland or something, everything is kind of too perfect and clean and nice and fancy. I still had a good time there recovering from the bustrip. It was also my first tip-off that California would be quite different from the US that I had seen in my only previous trip to the States - through Pittsburgh and Buffalo.</p><p><strong>Going up north/Santa Cruz</strong><br />My first Greyhound on this trip left at 11PM, and arrived in LA at 3AM. I slept part of the journey. LA Greyhound station was a bit scary, especially at night - a lot of sketchy characters. There was a black angry boy next to me, talking on the payphone for about half an hour with some friend of his, swearing and cussing about his mother, his girlfriend (f*ing bitch), how he was going to kill them all etc. There was also some problems between the driver and some passengers, and we got off to a late start.</p><p>I slept much of the trip, and arrived in Santa Cruz at mid-day. Of course, I had lost the note with my friend&#8217;s phone number, and had to find the public library, in order to log on to the internet and get his number again. Then I called him, and he came to pick me up. We went to a veggie cafe, and I had a huge veggie-burger with fries. </p><p>I had worked with Jason virtually all summer, from Mexico, and it was interesting finally seeing him. I was staying with him and his partner in their beautiful house outside Santa Cruz. Great to sleep in a nice bed, have a shower, eat good vegan food, etc. We tried installing Linux on his computer, and somehow problems accumulated to the extent that we had to buy a new harddrive. I felt very bad about it, luckily we barely lost any data, and it all more or less sorted itself out in the end. BACKUP!</p><p>We saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which I didn&#8217;t like much. I made them my famous scrambled tofu, and off I was.</p><p><strong>Palo Alto</strong><br />I went downt to Palo Alto and wandered around Stanford University all day. Unfortunately a very good friend of mine who studies there is in India right now, and I had nobody to show me around. Also, there were not many students there because of summer break. It was still interesting to see, and fun to know where my friend studies. </p><p>I then met up with Charles H., my history professor from my high-school in Italy, that I had not seen since. He has two kids now, adorable ones. I staid with his family for two days and we had a good time catching up.<br /><strong><br />San Francisco/Madera</strong><br />I took the Caltrain in to San Francisco, and went to meet Leroy, a former student of Charles who lives in the Castro area (the gay area) of San Francisco. I dumped my stuff there, walked around for a while in this beautiful hilly area with lot&#8217;s of great shops, restaurants, &#8230; I even got a free paper-copy of <a href=""http://www.theonion.com"">the Onion</a>. We had a wonderful lunch in his lush gardens, and then I went on to Madera.</p><p>In Madera, I had my maiden voyage as a <a href=""http://www.hospitalityclub.org"">Hospitality Club guest</a>, and a good experience it was. I was staying with Steve D., social worker and ESL teacher, and his wife and young boy. They were wonderful hosts, taking me around Madera and Fresno, we had great food and good talks, and lot&#8217;s of playing with little Edgar. He also had a big US map on the wall that I used in planning my travels (see previous post).</p><p><strong>San Francisco/Berkeley</strong><br />I came back to San Francisco at two PM, and walked around in Chinatown and Nob hill (the snobby area). On the way down to Fisherman&#8217;s wharf, I came across the Norwegian Seaman&#8217;s Church, which is kind of famous. I popped in, and was offered waffles and coffee by a very nice Norwegian working there. I read some Norwegian papers, and had a good chat in Norwegian. I also realized we have elections coming up - probably I&#8217;ll arrange to vote by distance from the consulate in New York.</p><p><strong>Now</strong><br />And now I am staying with a friendly couple in Berkeley, two Dutch people, one of them a UWC grad. I was going to stay with a Hospitality Club member in San Francisco, but that fell through, so I was a bit desperate. Leroy (the friend I had visited on my first trip through) suggested I mail the UWC mailing list in the Bay Area. I was sceptical, since I needed a place to stay <strong>tomorrow</strong>, but within three hours I had three positive answers! (And one more came the day after). Amazing. </p><p>In two days, I am off to LA. </p><p>Stian</p>",Abbrevations,"US,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/08/02/abbrevations/,"<p>Just a quickie:</p><p>Even though I thought my command of the English language was quite good, I was baffled by &#8220;PED XING&#8221; that was frequently painted on the roads in Palo Alto. Turns out it means Pedestrian Crossing. Doh. Is there really not space to write all of it? I happen to find Xing a very ugly abbreviation. Kind of like every time a movie is subtitles in Spanish, usted/ustedes (you in singular, plural) is abbreviated Ud/Uds. In the same way, I found my brain always stopping up to process it, taking a second extra. Probably just because I am not used to it.</p><p>Stian</p>",Los Angeles: the Zen of travelling,"personal,US,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/08/09/los-angeles-the-zen-of-travelling/,"<p><strong>Travelling</strong><br />When my family used to travel, they did it very differently than I do now. They&#8217;d be working hard all year, saving up vacation days and money, and then we&#8217;d often go off on a two week jaunt to for example a Spanish island, spend lot&#8217;s of money on hotels, food and airfare, and hope to have &#8220;intensive fun&#8221; to make up for a long year of drudgery. To be fair, it&#8217;s not easy to travel with three kids, and we did go camping a lot in Norway as well. </p><p>Travelling as I do, and have mostly done in my life, with very little money and a lot of time is a very different thing, with its own challenges and rewards. You are forced to rely heavily on other people (because I cannot usually afford hotels, at least not in the first world), you often travel on buses, trains, walk around in strange cities with a big backpack not knowing where you are going to go next. There is no chartered plane that is met by hotel busses whisking you straight to the pool, and the breakfast buffet. The upside is that you see a lot more of the real society, you meet a lot of wonderful people, and you often find yourself in interesting and funny situations. The downside is that it can be very tiring.</p><p><strong>Los Angeles</strong><br />I walked around San Francisco a whole day; met a friend from the project in Mexico for lunch, and finally got on the night-bus to Los Angeles at around 11PM. The trip was uneventful, and we arrived in Los Angeles at 7:25 in the morning. I already knew from a previous visit that the Los Angeles Greyhound station is kind of scary (especially at 3AM, which is when I was there last time), and that it was in a rundown-part of town, but my host had promised to meet me. I was waiting outside for about an hour, until I gave up. I tried calling her from a payphone, but could not get through. The nice Chinese lady that I helped interpret for in San Francisco (she didn&#8217;t speak a word of English) lent me her cellphone, but nobody picked up on the other end. OK, I just dropped my luggage there, and walked in to town.</p><p>Los Angeles is certainly not the best city to walk around in, but I was lucky enough to stumble upon a tourist bureau that provided me with free maps (these should be available at all Greyhound stations!) and some information about different walks that I could take. They told me that I could use the public library for free internet, so I went there to see if my friend had written anything. She told me that I could contact her later, and that she was quite busy that day. I was kind of tired, so I chose a book and sat down in a nice chair.</p><p>A while later, I wake up, in a nice chair, with a book about the Ruby programming language open on my lap. It took me a while to figure out where I was. I left, got something to eat, and headed for Hollywood. The street called Hollywood boulevard is where a lot of Hollywood movie history was made, but right now it&#8217;s not very glamorous. At least I got to see the star&#8217;s footprints in the concrete, and where the Oscar&#8217;s are handed out. A tout convinced me to do a &#8220;tour of the star&#8217;s homes&#8221; (I figured I&#8217;m not in Hollywood that often, might as well). </p><p>I finally got in touch with my friend, and she told me she&#8217;d be helping her uncle photograph his scooters at a warehouse downtown, at 10PM. I made my way there, and was standing outside the gate waiting for her uncle to open up. The warehouse was in a sketchy part of town, and several &#8220;interesting&#8221; individuals came up to me to &#8220;chat&#8221;. I was happy when he let me in.</p><p>The shoot turned out to take a lot of time&#8230; a <em>lot</em> of time, in fact they didn&#8217;t finish until 8 in the morning. (She always thougth they&#8217;d finish really soon, so she didn&#8217;t take me home in the meantime). We all arrived at her parents&#8217; house completely devastated, and fell into bed. When I woke up, around 2:30, she was gone. Her mother gave me a glass of Apple juice before she left, and there was only her little sister back. I didn&#8217;t know what was going on, tried to call her but her cellphone was at home. I just sat there, watching Chinese TV on a bigscreen, waiting for the world to make sense again. </p><p><strong>Profound conclusion</strong><br />Sometimes you need to step back and think, wow: I am in a big warehouse in downtown Los Angeles, with Chinese workes taking catalogue pictures of imported scooters! Or, wow: I am in a nice suburban Los Angeles house, drinking apple juice, and watching a Chinese drama, or wow: I am in the multimedia lab at University of Arizona, soaking wet because of the crazy rain, helping my friend digitize cassettes of tradition Chinese ethnic music&#8230; The last one is right now, while I am writing this.</p><p>So yes, travelling like this can be tiresome. Walking around all day, carrying bags, waiting for buses, for people&#8230; not knowing what&#8217;s going on, wondering what&#8217;s the polite thing to do, what&#8217;s going to happen next? Things might not work out as you thought, but in exchange you get to meet some amazing people, experience some great situations, accumulate some great stories to tell!</p><p>Stian</p>",Phone crime and DVD rental,"tech,US,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/08/11/phone-crime-and-dvd-rental/,"<p>Just two small things I picked up on the bus trip from Tucson to Albuquerque.</p><p><strong>Phone crime in Mexico</strong><br />In Hermosillo, Mexico, criminals called several pharmacies in town, threatening the employees&#8217; lives, and demanding that the employees scratch phonecards and read the codes over the phone (as you know, you don&#8217;t need to own the actual phonecards, as long as you have the access number and the code). They told the employees&#8217; that they were just around the corner, and described several people who entered the store at that time. They ended up with substantial amounts of codes worth a lot of money. However, the police said they will catch them when they try to add these codes to any phone number. (In Mexico, most people are not billed for the fixed-lined phones in their homes, but use pay-as-you-go, buying phone cards to add to their credit.)<br />From the Spanish weekly in Tucson.</p><p><strong>DVD rental on the go</strong><br />In a rest stop on the Greyhound trip to Albuquerque I noticed something interesting. The store (which was apparently a chain-store, or at least there would have to be other stores participating in this program) rented out DVDs that you could hand in to any other participating store. Ie, if you had portable DVD-players in the car (hopefully not on the driver&#8217;s side) you could rent a movie, and hand it back in two hours later in a different location. Interesting. (I know they do something similar on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV"">TGV trains</a> in France - you can rent a portable DVD-player and a movie in Paris, and then you hand it back in in Lille, or Marseille or where you might end up. Smart stuff.</p><p>Stian </p>",Albuquerque Rocks! (And Poetry Slams Too),"personal,US,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/08/16/albuquerque-rocks-and-poetry-slams-too/,"<p><strong>Albuquerque</strong><br />I arrived in Albuquerque from Tucson at around 9AM on Wednesday, dumped my luggage and set out to explore. I walked around all day in the sun, eating some great Mexican food at a place where they were even playing one of the most popular songs down in Sinaloa (<em>Que se queda con ganas, con ganas</em>). I walked down a little trail into a forest patch, found a little creek and waded in. Great stuff. Then I read the free weekly sitting there on the banks. I love free weeklies! This one just happened to tell me that the annual National Poetry Slam had just begun, with competitions and events all over town! There was also going to be some kind of a festival on Saturday. Great I thought, looks like a fun week.</p><p>I walked up to the University of New Mexico, and found free internet access in the science library. Later John, from Hospitality Club picked me up, took me for a ride around the city, and we went back to his little pad for dinner (I made some Asian-ish stir fry). John&#8217;s a middle-age welder, but that&#8217;s only half the story. He&#8217;s travelled a lot himself, lived in different countries, and he is one of those great openminded individuals who reads books, talks to strange people and find the world interesting. We had a lot to talk about. Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t have much time after this, but who knows if our paths will cross in the future. The next day I mostly slumbered around the house (watching crazy Mexican TV shows) and catching up on my emailing at the university. </p><p><strong>Poetry Slam</strong><br />At night I went downtown to catch the semi-finals of the poetry slam. At one venue, I was not allowed, since my Norwegian ID was not good enough for them. Luckily there was another venue that was all ages. I came there quite early, and could not get a seat (it was a crowded restaurant), and when the slam finally started I was feeling quite tired and annoyed. But with the first three-minute group piece my tiredness was blown away. This was good stuff! Although the competition lasted for several hours, I was as excited as in a ball-game - after the poems we cheered and stomped our feet at the judges who dared give low grades, and some of the poetry and the performance of them was just amazing!</p><p>Prior to this I had only once been at a real poetry slam, in Malmoe, Sweden. That was very local talent and very variable performance (although still fun). This was the best that the US had to offer, and good stuff! I decided to postpone going to Denver by a few hours (catching the 1AM bus instead of the 8:30PM) and catch the finals the next day.</p><p><strong>We Art the People</strong><br />The next day, after buying tickets, I went to the park to see what the fuzz was all about. I think the festival was called &#8220;We Art the People&#8221;, and it was kind of a coming-out of all of Albuquerque&#8217;s local talent, they had three stages that featured everything from older woman dancing Hawaiian dance to a guy with a beatbox sampling himself and turning himself into a whole orchestra that sounded awesome. There was good food (although there could have been more variety), paintings, sculptures, huge robots made of junk, tapestries&#8230; And workshops where kid could learn to paint, etc. In a nice park, in the sunshine - it was just awesome. The poetry slam finals in a huge convention hall that must have held more than a 1000 people, and was full, were great too. The individual performances were really good, although I thought many of the group pieces were weak, and I sometimes thought people we applauding more for the political contents than the lyrical qualities.</p><p><strong>Denver</strong><br />The first day that I arrived in Denver, my hosts (good friends from back in China), had already been planning to go see a poetry slam there. We ended up at a great organic cafe of sorts, and listened to a band jam with a poetry reading, but were to tired to stay for the entire thing. Finally, yesterday, my friend rented &#8220;Slam&#8221;, an old movie about a drug-dealer cum poet who is imprisoned in Washington DC and uses his lyric-writing skills to stay out of trouble. So it&#8217;s really been a week full of poetry. But I just love dumping into these kind of things. Coming in to Albuquerque and reading in the Alibi that the National Poetry Slam was ongoing might not have been entirely like arriving in Salt Lake City, Utah and finding out that the Sundance Film Festival just started, and you got a free pass &#8212; but it&#8217;s close <img src=&#039;http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&#039; alt=&#039;:)&#039; class=&#039;wp-smiley&#039; /> </p><p>Here&#8217;s a <a href=""http://m-pyre.blogspot.com/2005/08/poets-passing.html"">first-hand account</a> from someone who helped arrange the nationals.</p><p>Next stop Kansas City.</p><p>Stian</p>",The Wisdom of Crowds,"books,economics,politics,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/08/16/the-wisdom-of-crowds/,"<p><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0385503865.01._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,45,-64_AA240_SH20_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg"" alt=""Book cover"" align=""right"" /></p><p>This was on my reading list for a long time, finally picked it up at the Denver Public Library and read it in one sitting.

The average will be very close to the truth.    </li><li> What is needed for a group to work: some individual information (could be bias, different approach etc), not leaning or depending too much on the others in the group, being able to express/agregate their information (voting, markets - not reaching consensus).    </li><li> Price markets work well because of this. Stock markets not so well because everyone want to predict what others think, not what the value of companies are.    </li><li> Examples of why corporations exist, very much in line with &#8220;The Efficient Society&#8221; by Joseph Heath.    </li><li> My thought: can the last be transferred to the elections in the US? The two candidates that run for election are not presenting voters with a great deal of choice, so the primaries are very important. But with the last Democratic primaries, people did not try to vote for the person they thought would best do the job, but rather the person that they thought other people thought would best do the job (ie the person who was most &#8220;electible&#8221;), and thus their choice was perhaps wrong.</li></ul><p>274 p.</p><p>Stian</p>",People don&#8217;t steal in Fayetteville,"personal,US,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/08/22/people-dont-steal-in-fayetteville/,"<p>So I just got off the bus in Fayetteville, Arkansas, a little town half an hour from the Wal-Mart world headquarters, and two hours from Bill Clinton&#8217;s presidential library in Little Rock. It&#8217;s a tiny bus station, not Greyhound like I&#8217;m used to, but Jefferson Lines. I am not meeting my hosts for a few hours, so I go in and ask the man behind the counter if I can store my luggage there for a few hours. He tells me to put it across the room on one of the benches. I ask him if he would keep an eye on it. He says: &#8220;People don&#8217;t steal in Fayetteville. Besides, nobody would bother with that big thing even if it was full of 100$ bills.&#8221;</p><p>Not really my normal modus operandi, but I took out my mp3-player of the bag and trust my laundry with faith&#8230; Hopefully it will still be there when I return in an hour.</p><p>(I still have stories from Denver and Kansas City, but they&#8217;ll have to come in non-chronological order).</p><p><em>Update: Three days later, as I went down to the station in the morning to take the bus out of Fayetteville, another man with several bags asked the same Jefferson Lines&#8217; attendant whether he could leave his bags behind the counter. He got the same reply, that nobody steals in Fayetteville. When he pressed the issue, he was told that being in Fayetteville is like being in a mother&#8217;s arms, and that someone had once left a bag for two weeks there, without problems.

I quickly found the main drag, Dickson street, got a free deodorant as a gift to incoming freshman in the bookstore, and chanced upon the university. Not only did they have a very kind policy of actively allowing random strangers to use their computers, but the campus was also buzzing with life, because it was the first day of school! After getting up to date on my emails, I grabbed the free campus weekly, and sat on the outside steps of the library, looking over Union Plaza I think it was called, onto the main student center. There were students milling everywhere, lost freshmen trying to find their classes, or supplies, or just a friendly hand to hold. Sororities and fraternities, clubs and organizations promoting themselves, the student association frying hamburgers on the square for anyone who wanted them. It all reminded me wonderfully of my first tentative days at UTSC about a year ago, fresh off the plane without a student permit, trudging my 50kg backpack up the hill to the UTSC campus. Ah, memories.</p><p>The next evening, I was checking my email in the living room of the kind group of girls that had agreed to host me, while they were completing their &#8220;moving in&#8221;, setting aside closets and lockers, deciding on house rules, how much food would be bought collectively and how much privately, planning dinners together and what not. Also this reminded me not only of many wonderful past collectives, but also of my new home in Augusta Ave. in Toronto with four others - we are moving in very soon, and no doubt will we have the same discussions about sharing bread, and who takes out the garbage. </p><p>Thank&#8217;s for having me, Fayetteville.</p><p>Stian</p>","Thank you, Memphis!","personal,US,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/08/25/thank-you-memphis/,"<p>As some of you might know, I had very ambitious plans for yesterday. I was scheduled to leave Fayetteville at 8:15 in the morning, spend a few hours on the bus to get to Little Rock, visit Bill Clinton&#8217;s Presidential Library for a few hours, go on to Memphis, spend all evening walking around there, and leave with the nightbus for New Orleans. Then I would have a whole day (arriving very early in the morning) to walk around, and another nightbus would take me to Gainesville, GA, where I was scheduled to visit a couple that lives on an ecological farm. An uncharacteristically stressfull schedule, but it meant I wouldn&#8217;t have to pay for any hotels, and would still at least get a bit of an impression of a lot of sights.</p><p>Things didn&#8217;t really work out that way. Somehow, and I am not sure if I did anything wrong, of if this is just how routes work, I ended up going from Fayetteville to Fort Smith to Texarcana which is in Texas! back up to Little Rock. All in all, I was in Little Rock at 5:40PM, and of course had to continue straight on to Memphis (I did see the library from the window - so near, and yet so far away). I arrived in Memphis with an hour and a half to spare until the nightbus, having been travelling since 7:30 in the morning, waiting in bus depots all over Arkansas&#8230;</p><p>Yet, I figured I&#8217;d try to catch a bit of air, so I left my big bag on the floor outside the New Orleans-bound bus, took my small bus and trudged out. Magically, within an hour, I had not only been able to have a delicious vegan burger and fries at Denny&#8217;s, but I also caught a part of a great open-air jazz concert in the park, completely by chance. People were dancing, the musicians were playing, the Memphis skyline was glowing, and I thought: Thank you, Memphis&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t all for nothing. I promise I&#8217;ll come back some day!</p><p>Stian </p>","The Art Haus hostel in Asheville, NC","personal,US,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/08/29/the-art-haus-hostel-in-asheville-nc/,"<p><img src=""http://www.feelfreefarmproject.org/campinout.jpg""/><br /><br />I spent about a day walking around in New Orleans, checking out the French Quarter and downtown. (It feels very strange watching scenes of devastation from New Orleans today on TV, when I was there only a few days ago.) I then made my way to Gainesville, GA., where I would stay at an ecological farm up in the mountains, run by &#8220;Hillydilly&#8221; and Marie, two hippies with an attitude. The farm, which doesn&#8217;t grow anything but has cows, goats and chicken is located remotely in a forest, but the peace and quiet isn&#8217;t enough for the couple - they choose to camp out many nights, in a little opening in the forest where they&#8217;ve made an outdoors kitchen. We spent two evenings there, baking bread in an earthen owen, drumming, listening to the stars and discussing buddhism and alternative lifestyles. </p><p>I of course am a vegan, and don&#8217;t really approve of keeping animals - even in the much more humane ways that Hillydilly and Marie does. But I am openminded, and enjoyed our conversations and discussions about the topic. They explained that they had an &#8220;open-door&#8221; policy - if you staid beyond three days, you were expected to work two hours a day. They often take in people who need some time in a safe environment to &#8220;find themselves&#8221;, &#8220;figure their lives out&#8221;&#8230; it&#8217;s an amazing work providing such a safe haven of hospitality and friendship!</p><p>I was going to take the overnight bus to Asheville, NC. to visit a girl I met briefly in China four years ago. But as it turned out that the bus trip would take 12 hours and arrive at 4AM, whereas it&#8217;s only a three hour drive, they suggested driving me up on Sunday, and housing me in a hostel. Although I wasn&#8217;t planning on staying a single night in a hostel during my travels, I agreed that it would be a good idea. And I don&#8217;t regret it - we (they ended up being convinced to stay as well) staid in the best hostel ever, the Art Haus. A nice little wooden house, close to downtown, with a porch and a back yard, 20$ for a dorm room&#8230; lovingly decorated, a nice kitchen you can use, but great people! The owner, a lovely woman, was always ready to talk and find out about her guests, her two daughters always running around. A guy who had come to visit had staid for several months helping out at the hostel in exchange for a place to sleep; the guests were artists, backpackers, good people. In the evening, we all went out to the African music festival, to shoot pool, and eat sushi (in that order). Later, we huddled in the TV room (which was like someone&#8217;s living room) watching Hurricane Katrina progress towards New Orleans. </p><p>I&#8217;ve learnt a lot from this backpacking trip throughout the US, and one of my &#8220;lessons&#8221; is that although staying with people (friends/HospitalityClub members, etc) is great and valuable, sometimes a day or two in a hostel or similar can be good as well - not only to relax (not always feel that you are in someone&#8217;s home, you have to be polite and nice to people, etc), but also to make the planning of a schedule a little bit more flexible. </p><p>In about half an hour I will be meeting up with my friend here in Asheville, this city that turns out to be a giant hippie-place, where even the Irish pub serves veggie-burgers&#8230; and I had no idea when I went here.

It&#8217;s been a little over a week now, but it seems a lot longer. From the day I arrived here, tired and dirty, with a backpack full of laundry - to a room completely empty except for a dresser. I gradually assembled some second-hand and free furniture, got all my old stuff over from my friend, who had been storing it during the summer, and slowly assembled a livable space. Now it&#8217;s quite nice in here.</p><p><strong>Economics Choices</strong><br />I am usually OK at handling money - although far from great at it. I do stupid stuff like spending five minutes trying to calculate which toilet paper is cheapest (based on the prize divided by meters of paper), and then buy a magazine that I could have just as well read in the library), and sometimes I run out and have to borrow from my friends (thank you). But generally, I end up spending more or less what I have. No credit card debts, no car loans&#8230; But of course a huge student loan.</p><p><strong>Big Money Spending</strong><br />However, one thing that is really difficult for me is deciding when to spend &#8220;big money&#8221;&#8230; like flying somewhere to see a friend, buying a big ticket item, etc. This is all the more difficult because the money I have is mostly a loan that I will have to pay back when I get a job (hopefully), and I get my student loan in two big chunks, one each semester. So suddenly you have this big chunk of money, that you haven&#8217;t really earned or deserved, and that will one day have to be paid back. Spending money on decent living, food etc, is obvious. But deciding to fly to Mexico to see my friend for two weeks, even though I might &#8220;have the money&#8221; right now, is far harder. As is deciding whether to buy a digital camera or not. Especially because I don&#8217;t have any obvious sources of income, and even though I &#8220;have the money now&#8221; &#8212; if I didn&#8217;t use it, I might do something amazing with it next summer.</p><p>So I&#8217;ve been agonizing about this for a while. Which of course does not mean that I&#8217;ve never spent big money. But I always spend lots of time agonizing over it, and then in the end purchase things mostly on impulse, as in, I&#8217;ve thought about this too long, I&#8217;ll just do it.</p><p>At least I am independent from my family, which is an important thing in the culture that I come from. Since I turned 19 and graduated from high school, they&#8217;ve basically never given me any money (except for Christmas gifts and the like). This is of course made possible by the quite generous Norwegian state student loans/scholar ships. And even though I think I waste a lot of money, and buy useless things &#8212; looking back at my post-high school life, I have done an incredible amount of traveling and experiences.</p><p><strong>New Computer</strong><br />Either way, I just bought an iBook and an iPod. That&#8217;s what prompted this entry. I am still not sure if it was a good decision (but sometimes you just have to accept your decisions and move on), and it was something I was thinking about for weeks. I had a lot of chance to play with Macs during the summer, and got to really like them. I also needed a new mp3 player since my trusted Creative Zen bit the grass, sadly. And Apple, deviously, gives a 225$ mail-in rebate if you purchase an iBook and an iPod together. Thus - should I buy an iPod alone. What if I&#8217;d want to buy an iBook later (say before I went on placement in 8 months), then I&#8217;d loose the discount&#8230; Did I really need a laptop?</p><p>I thought about this, calculated my money, asked my friends. Finally, about half an hour before the campus bookstore was closing, I decided to only get an iPod. I didn&#8217;t need a laptop. I walked quickly down to the bookstore, hoping it would still be open, and entered. And in a split second, I decided to get the iBook too. 15 minutes later, I walked out of there, one 12&#8243; iBook and a 60gb iPod richer, $1900 poorer (although I&#8217;ll get $225 back on the rebate). Excited, but very unsure. Then I had to pay the tuition and suddenly I have very little money to live for this term. Of course I&#8217;ll get by, especially if I get a job that I think I will get. And I might sell some of my old equipment. And it is an awesome piece of technology, and now that my house has broadband, it&#8217;s great. But&#8230; was it the right choice?</p><p><strong>Alternatives</strong><br />And just chatting with one of my friends she characterized me as an amazing spendthrift, because I got a mattress from free off the street, and would rather walk 10km than take a cab. It&#8217;s weird, and I can&#8217;t explain it. I just spent a huge amount of money on something nice, but non-essential. Instead, I could have flown down to Mexico and seen my best friend again like three times this year, or I could probably single-handedly have build a school in a third world country. Or, or.</p><p>How are we supposed to make these decisions? What are the criteria? I might have to spend more time working in a job that I won&#8217;t enjoy now - so I just traded my spare time, for a computer&#8230; Am I that materialistic?</p><p>Still wondering,<br />Stian</p>","Heartburn Home Remedy => After reading   this article, I   feel that I really need more info.

You can buy bags, belts,  microphones, radio transmitters - you can put linux on them, use the notes function to read online novels and more. One of the things I briefly noticed a few months ago, before I had my own, was that several cities&#8217; subway maps had been broken up into appropriate sized pictures and <a href=http://www.ipodsubwaymaps.com>made available for download</a>. That way, you&#8217;d always have them available in your pocket. Just one other smart little idea.</p><p>Apparently it was too good to last, because they just received cease-and-desist letters from both the New York City and the San Francisco (liberal anyone?) subway systems, saying that they had to immediately remove the maps, since this was copyrighted material. Although they might technically be right, this is about the most short-sighted thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. Surely as a subway, and a city, you would appreciate more people riding your subway! And any way of making this information more accessible should be a positive thing! Luckily Boston has written to them and told them to freely use their map, and they are now contacting other cities about this. Toronto is also on the list - I really hope they let them use it freely.</p><p>This also impacts me, because I was loosely toying with the idea of making Toronto transit information more easily accessible. However, that should still be fine, since the pure information cannot be copyrighted, but the map design can. (So one option would be to make new maps based on the existing information - which would of course only serve to confuse users).</p><p>I haven&#8217;t been very active lately, since getting back into school - it&#8217;s been a weird period of trying to map out how the next four months are going to be.

That made me very happy. I remember discussing high gas prices with a friend I was staying over with in Arkansas (this was before Hurricane Katrina, but gas prices were still high in general), and how I believed that it was a good thing. She kind of brushed me off, saying that it would not make a difference - Americans would always drive. I didn&#8217;t entirely agree, but I kept that to myself. After Katrina though, I read a USA Today article listing examples of how people were saving gas - officers were patrolling on foot, freight companies hired experts in stacking, which reduced the need for trucks, etc. And coming back to Toronto, statistics show that more people are taking public transportation or ride sharing. </p><p>Of course, these are short term changes, that are naturally limited because people are still living with the same structures - city planning, public transportation etc. What we really need is sustained high oil prices, that can slowly lead to changes in city and transportations structures. And I actually think that will happen either way. Hopefully Canada (where I am living now) will aceept this as a great opportunity - to develop green technology, and create employment while improving the social and natural environment.</p><p>Stian</p>",Ivy League admissions,"economics,US,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/10/11/ivy-league-admissions/,"<p>In an <a href=http://www.newyorker.com/critics/atlarge/articles/051010crat_atlarge>interesting article in the New Yorker</a>, Malcolm Gladwell discusses the history of the admission systems for the Ivy League schools in the US, especially focusing on Harvard. One of his points is that the admissions procedure was changed from one focusing purely on academic merit to one focusing more on &#8220;the whole person&#8221; (references, interview, etc) because the percentage of Jews admitted was fast increasing. He ends by concluding that Harvard is being managed like a &#8220;luxury-brand&#8221;; drawing parallells to how the manufacturer of a high-end sports car wouldn&#8217;t want mostly black women to drive around in them, since they would lover the perception of the brand.</p><p>Fascinating.</p><p>Stian</p>",Online learning,,http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/10/11/online-learning/,"<p>Right now I am sitting in the library the University of Buffalo (visiting a friend over Thanksgiving), watching the last lecture for one of my classes - online. One of my classes is full, so I can take it online. The video is posted each week, and taken down after a week (to avoid you saving it all up until the day before the exams), and it&#8217;s accompanied by the powerpoint slides. Exams and papers are done as usual. I have a lot of thoughts about what this all means/might mean to the university in the future. Although I don&#8217;t foresee, nor would like to see, everyone sitting at home around their monitors all day, I see big change coming up. Change that could be incredibly positive when it comes to widening access to information and learning both to underprivileged in developed countries and to developing countries. Of course, it could also be horriby mismanaged and lead to firing of professors in a bid to save money while not improving quality.</p><p>There is more and more free audio and lately video content available online, which is very exciting to me.

Here are some of my disparate findings (sources: <a href=""http://www.ssb.no/english/"">Statistics Norway</a>, <a href=""http://www.cida.ca"">CIDA</a>, <a href=""http://www.norad.no"">Norad</a> and <a href=""http://odin.dep.no/ud/english/bn.html"">the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> - let me know if you want a specific reference for any of this).</p><p><b>Development aid:</b> Norway gives about 0.92% of GDP, Canada gives 0.25%. That coupled with a higher GDP/capita for Norway, means that Norway gives very close to the same real amount of development aid as Canada - even though Norway has 4.5 million inhabitants, and Canada around 30 million. </p><p><b>Farming subsidies:</b> Norwegian agriculture employs about 71,000 &#8220;full-time worker equivalents&#8221; (for example 142,000 half-time workers, etc). The full amount of Norwegian agricultural subsidies divided by the number of full time worker equivalents yields an average of $50,000 CAD in state subsidies per &#8220;worker&#8221;. This amounts to almost 3% of Norway&#8217;s GDP (and thus more than three times our development budget).</p><p><b>Newspapers:</b> Our biggest daily, VG, ranks as the 51st biggest newspaper in the world (in terms of circulation), with a circulation of over 800,000 copies daily. Probably because we are a newspaper-reading country with few national newspapers to choose from, compared to other countries. (Even very well known international English and American newspapers, like the Times and the Washington Post, have surprisingly low circulation). I believe the newspaper with the highest circulation was Korean.</p><p><b>Oil:</b> Norway is the third biggest oil exporter in the world. This surprised me quite a bit. However, part of the reason is that we spend very little of what we produce, compared to larger oil producing nations. (The two others are Saudia Arabia, and Russia). </p><p><b>Universities:</b> The University of Oslo and the University of Toronto&#8217;s budgets, controlled for the number of students, are roughly similar in size. However, in Norway the government covers the whole bill, whereas in Canada, the students pay roughly half. </p><p>Stian</p>",Changing concepts of universities,"economics,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/10/31/changing-concepts-of-universities/,"<p>Something that I have thought about a lot lately, is changing concepts of what a university is, and how it works. Some of the reasons that I have been thinking so much about this stems from the idea of elite universities in North America. They have always been fascinating to me, because I come from a country with only five universities, all of them in their own cities, and roughly equal in quality - you choose the university based on the city you want to live in, and not the quality of the courses. (They are also fully publically funded, etc.). They are certainly quality institutions, but what I always wondered was; what has Harvard got, that makes it so much better? And also, thinking of developing countries; why is it so hard to have stellar institutions? Especially for the humanities and social sciences, it would seem that the most important aspect is the teachers - and since teachers are much cheaper in developing countries, that should achievable.</p><p>(Of course brain drain is one factor, I realized later. But that is far from the full answer.)</p><p>So I started thinking about which parts of Harvard, or Yale, make them so stellar. (Especially from the perspective of undergraduate teaching, not research). And with the advent of technology, these thoughts intensified. If the reason Harvard is so good is the library, and we have that library available online - then what? If the reason is the courses, and we can do the courses online? If the reason is the tight student relationships, and we can imitate that?</p><p>The Economist has advocated for splitting up the teaching and the testing part of for example Oxford or Yale; letting everyone in the world do the same tests. So that, I could study bioengineering in Vietnam, but still do the rigorous sample of MIT tests (perhaps including essays and projects), paid for of course at a competitive rate, and if I succeeded I would receive an MIT diploma completely equivalent to the one that MIT students get. Thus, MIT the teaching institution would have to focus on provable excellency in teaching, not on whom they accept and the reputation of their institution. It&#8217;s a fascinating idea for &#8220;democratizing&#8221; education (one of course fraught with dangers, if educational evaluation becomes reduced to multiple choice tests at all levels), and one which MIT would surely fight against. They seem to do the opposite - the MIT OpenCourseWare project provides access to much of their teaching material, sometimes even video or audio of their lectures, for free to anyone in the world. BUT - they will never lead you to get an MIT certification. You can get our teaching, but not our degree.</p><p>Stian<br />(sorry, no sources - no time; ask me)</p>",Paypal meets micro finance,"development,economics,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/11/01/paypal-meets-micro-finance/,"<p>This is simply awesome!

He makes many arguments in the book, many of which I agree to, although I think he is quite a little bit too optimistic about technodeterminism and the whole world becoming equal and happy. One of his starting thoughts, which I quite liked, is (paraphrased) &#8220;Fifty years ago, if you were given the choice between growing up a genious in Shanghai or a dumb kid in Poughkepsie, which would you choose? Poughkepsie, because there you&#8217;d have the best shot at a nice life. You&#8217;d work for some factory, find a wife, have some children&#8230; Today? Shanghai! The sky&#8217;s the limit for smart people in Shanghai (ideally), but the dumbo in Poughkepsie would loose his job to an Indian&#8221;&#8230;</p><p>(Of course, would you rather be a smart kid in Sierra Leone? No&#8230;, didn&#8217;t think so. Not flat enough yet.)</p><p>He also gives a fascinating account of how it came to be that the outsourcing to India grew so incredibly fast. It all started with the Y2K problems, when millions of lines of code had to be combed by mid-level software engineers in a short timespan. American just didn&#8217;t have enough coders, and these were relatively simply tasks, so they were outsourced to India. At around the same time is the dotcom-bubble, during which companies thought that the internet would just keep growing at an amazing speed, and literally threw money after anything with .com in their name. This included companies lying fiberoptic cables to connect the world, including the US and India. The bubble burst, and US companies had to downsize or went burst. The fiberoptics companies went bankrupt, and the bank got their cable; it sold it for close to nothing to other companies.</p><p>As US companies were downsizing, they had to send a lot of Indian software engineers home. However, they also needed to get the same amount of work done, but cheaper. So they thought, why can&#8217;t Rajiv, who did the work while he was in the States, do the same while he is in India - or maybe a little cheaper. So this combination of gaining a level of trust in the industry during the Y2K reprogramming, supercheap fiberoptics because of the dot-com burst, and US companies wanting to downsize, with Indian programmers that had US experience and contacts; it all came together and resulted in the current wave of outsourcing.</p><p>I thought it was fascinating. I knew it had happened, but never really asked why.</p><p>Much more in this book too, but I&#8217;ll stop here. Two quick facts: All the reservations for JetBlue (or was it WestJet? Hm) are done by Mormon stay-at-home wives in Salt Lake City. And UPS claims that 2% of the worlds GDP at any time is in one of their trucks. Hm.</p><p>Stian</p>","The End of Poverty, by Jeffrey Sachs","books,development,economics,politics,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/11/10/the-end-of-poverty-by-jeffrey-sachs/,"<p>I had the good fortune to listen to Sachs speak at the biannual CIDA conference in Ottawa last year. Although I had read things about him before the meeting describing him as some sort of &#8220;economic hitman&#8221;, I was impressed by his presentation. Now I just finished reading his book End of Poverty, Economic Possibilities for Our Times; a sort of global manifesto for reaching the Millenium Development Goals, and eradicating extreme poverty in the world by 2025. </p><p>It is important to note that Sachs talks about eradicating extreme poverty, not all poverty. He is not talking about how we can make all countries as wealthy as Norway or Canada - although that might be a long term goal - but how we can provide everyone with basic access to food, shelter, education and medical care. Less ambitious perhaps, but considering the proportions of people affected by extreme poverty today, certainly a very worth undertaking. </p><p>He starts off by chronicling the history of global economic growth (with the industrial revolution in England, etc), and clearly subscribes to the modernization theory of development, in hoping that all developing countries could get on the path to growth as well; and describing free trade as the most important way to achieve this. He then tries to asses why so many countries have not grown as rapidly as the Western ones.</p><p>He starts off by discussing growth in capital stock. Basically, an agricultural family&#8217;s income per capita can increase in the following ways: Saving (eating less of the corn grown, and selling it for money - using the money to invest in more livestock or capital equipment); Trade (specializing in a cash crop, using the money to buy more of the produce they used to produce); Technology (green revolution?); Resource boom (government controlling malaria enables household to move to higher yielding area). However, the same factors can lead to a decrease in household income: Lack of saving (leading to capital depreciation, lower yields in agriculture); Absence of trade (high opportunity cost of lack in communication, infrastructure (for taking produce to market), regulation, etc); Technological reversal (mother and father died by AIDS, orphans without technical farming knowledge produce less than the whole family could before); Natural resource decline (environmental decline - depreciation in nature?); Adverse productivity shock (natural disaster, etc); Population growth (more mouths to feed, but same amount of land).</p><p>The idea he harps over and over is that countries need to invest to grow (according to our class in political economy, you typically need to invest 5% of GDP to get a 1% increase in GDP - but that increase is beneficial every year, not just the year you achieve it). He mentions eight cateogries that can cause an economy to stagnate or decline: The poverty trap (people are so poor that no saving is viable, and it just gets worse); Physical geography (see below); Fiscal trap (no government money for infrastructure, health, education etc. Especially because of debt servicing); Governance Failures, Cultural barriers (traditional cultures? but also impediments to women working, caste systems, minorities disadvantaged etc. Failure to exploit full potential of population); Geopolitics (trade barriers by foreign countries); Lack of innovation (not enough local R&#038;D, foreign R&#038;D might not be appropriate. No funding, lack of IP legislation, etc); The demographic trap (population growth). </p><p>Those are many categories, but he does not by any means think that they are equally important. He talks a lot about geographical trade barriers - especially for land-locked countries (of which Africa has 15 - by far the most of any continent), or mountainous countries with little access to rivers etc. It is not strange, he says, that most booming centers of commerce are near major waterways. Or that Eastern China, close to the rest of Asia, or Europe/North America by ship, is doing well, while Western China, close to the steppes of Central Asia, and Afghanistan, are less prosperous. This does not mean that all is lost, but it needs to be taken into consideration.</p><p>He further discusses the problems of disease, especially in the African context. He makes reference to the excellent book Guns, Germs and Steel in stating that all continents were not born equal in terms of climate, domesticable animals or diseases. There is clearly something extra difficult within the African context, and it&#8217;s multitude of diseases is slowing down development. In fact Sachs was one of the first to suggest that it was economically profitable for a developing country to invest in public health (and he has been much criticized for this in the public health movement, for turning lives into numbers - but in a sense; if that is what it takes to raise investment, then maybe it is necessary). He came up with the idea for the Global AIDS, TB and Malaria fund, and believes that this is crucial to further Africa&#8217;s chances of development. </p><p>But finally, he thinks the most important aspect is simply the poverty trap. He debunks the myth of consistent huge transfers of funding to the poorest countries; in fact, most of it went to middle-income countries, and if you remove the percentage that was cancelling debts (nice, but those debts weren&#8217;t being serviced anyway, so the countries did not gain any extra income), paying for foreign experts (mostly wasted, but even the useful part did not help in adding to the investment stock of a country), you see that the real amounts were tiny. If you remove the money paid for debt servicing, the net flow was often negative. </p><p>He talks about clinical economics, as a parellell to clinical medicine; one needs to take symptoms, rule out different problems, and understand the whole system holistically. (I know critics of modern medicine who would not subscribe to this idealization of clinical medicine, but let&#8217;s roll with it). He criticizes the World Bank for employing very simplistic rules of thumb about growth and inflation, applied by economists that have very little local understanding of the regions they are dealing with. He is also skeptical to the thesis that the problem with Africa is governance, he posits that all countries in the world have governance problems, and that there is a certain relationship with the level of problems and the lack of resources. Fundamentally, Africa needs huge amounts of foreign aid, and when this is turned into investment and growth, the countries will become less corrupt. This does not mean that one should not try to counteract corruption, but one should not use this as an excuse for not investing in them.</p><p>He spends extensive time talking about his own role in stabilizing Bolivia and Poland, and in failing to do so with Russia; very interesting chapters, which I will not discuss here. </p><p>Five structural differences between China and Russia (partly explaining the former&#8217;s success and the latter&#8217;s lack of such): Soviets and Eastern Europe had massive foreign debts, China didn&#8217;t; China had a large coast-line that promoted export-led growth; China had the benefit of overseas Chinese promoting investment with cultural understanding; Soviet Union was experiencing drastic decline in oil production at outset of reforms, China wasn&#8217;t; Soviet Union had gone down further in the path of industrialization using technologies incompatible with Western standards, China hadn&#8217;t.</p><p>He gives an extensive example of the poverty trap and how to invest yourself out of it, positing that a family that makes 300$ a year can barely survive on it, and cannot save anything. Because of depreciation, it will only become poorer. However, through raising the income to 600$, they can save 300$ and invest this; which means that after that their income will be able to grow steadily. (I am simplifying enormously). Fundamentally he is making a case for why development aid would enable people to live  autonomously (after a number of years); this is not the case of committing to eternal charity and social service. </p><p>I could go on, and on. The book is quite amazing in that it is simultaneously packed with information, models for understanding development and concrete ideas, but also personal anecdotes (from a very interesting life) written in a very legible style. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand global economic development, and receive a little bit of optimism. After all, if development is impossible, we might as well give up. If it <em>is</em> possible, but we are not doing it; then we need to hold our governments responsible. I don&#8217;t agree with all that he says, but I found myself agreeing to a surprising amount. </p><p>Stian</p>",Eliminate pennies,"canada,economics,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/12/02/eliminate-pennies/,"<p><img src=http://www.discoversimcoe.com/images/tourism-misc/Canadian_Cent_rev.jpg align=right/>Ever since I came to Canada, I&#8217;ve been noticing a lot of small things about how things work, that I liked or didn&#8217;t like.

Partly because prices in Canada end up being so weird, because of taxes applied at the end ($1.13 for a donut?), and partly because the cent even exists. In Norway I can remember having one cents (1 NOK is roughly 0.18 CAD), then we got rid of that and only had .10 and .50. Now, we only have .50 and 1, 5, 10, 20 coins (and 50, 100, 200, 500 bills - the 200 and 500 bills are very common since that is what you get at the ATM, and they are roughly equal to $40 and $100). </p><p>So I&#8217;ve been advocating for abolishing at least the .01 and .05 (and preferably the 0.1 as well), since I never use them anyway. I regularly empty my wallet and take out anything smaller than .25, and put it in a jar. It takes too long to try to count up change, and sometimes if you try to pay a $2.5 sausage even with $.25s, they get annoyed. As well, the &#8220;take a penny, leave a penny&#8221; shows that people are not too concerned about these small units. I was always wondering though, whether there was a part of economics that studied which denominations would be the most efficient, etc. (This also stems from having been to both Laos and Uzebekistan where the biggest bill in circulation is the equivalent of $1 CAD! This led to people carrying wads and wads of money to the grocery store. And neither of these countries have galloping inflation today, although they might have had it in the past.)</p><p>So I was very happy when I came across <a href=""http://www.marklewis.ca/nocents/chande_fisher.pdf"">a study by Chande and Fisher</a> talking about abolishing the Canadian pennies. According to this author, it costs Canada 4,5 cents to produce each 1 cent, which in fact accounts for most of the coins produced. And if you count the cost to society of storing, counting etc, the cost for each penny comes to over 8 cents! By rounding alternatively up and down, the difference in prices would be almost zero by eliminating it. (In fact, even the five cent costs more to produce than it is worth). Several other countries have already eliminated their smallest currencies. (The one cent is now worth 1/15th of what it was when it was produced for the first time).</p><p>A final thought, I always wondered how the EU came up with the initial value for the Euro. I mean, since they established conversions from all the EU currencies, they could have established any numerical value - it would be equally much worth. (Ie instead of 1 DM being more or less .5 Euro, and a bread costing 1 Euro, 1DM could be equal to 4 Euro, and a bread could cost 8 Euro)&#8230; Is it that it wants to be roughly similar to a dollar? Perhaps this is nationalism, but I&#8217;ve always thought that a currency system with only one unit (ie we count in one NOK, one point five NOK, two NOK - and in some years, I am sure the .5 NOK will be eliminated as well) is easier to use and conceptualize then one with decimal places ($1.13) etc. But what do I know.</p><p>Stian</p>",Sound letters,"personal,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/12/07/sound-letters/,"<p>My best friends are scattered all around the world, which can be very frustrating at times. Luckily, more and more opportunities are appearing for staying in touch, Skype (and the Gizmo project) being perhaps the most important - free high quality phone calls over the internet. Works out of the box. (With Gizmo you can even leave short messages, surprisingly fun). I have still to try webcams, and don&#8217;t know how that works. Also, I have been experimenting with sound letters. </p><p>I think that even with the existence of Skype, etc, sound letters still have a function - sometimes I need to just &#8220;tell a story&#8221; or &#8220;complete a line of thought&#8221;, without needing to have someone say &#8220;mhm&#8221; or &#8220;yeah&#8221; all the time. Especially because talking to others, it is very easy to get derailed. This is of course the nature of a conversation, and often it is desirable. But sometimes, it can be annoying never to be able to make a certain point. So I have been experimenting with different ways of doing it. </p><p>The best is still using Audacity to record the sound, save it as an mp3 (usually takes almost as long as the sound file is, on my slow iBook), and email it through GMail (max 10 MB pr file). This works quite well. I tried out an online system today, called podomatic, where you can actually record straight over the web (through Flash). Unfortunately, it was very choppy (as in leaving out whole 30-second segments) which made my 10 minute coherent talk into incoherent rambling. (Okay, the first version was perhaps not that coherent, but the second one was immeasurably worse, almost absurd.)</p><p>The one annoying thing about internet phonecalls is sitting in front of your computer looking at the screen talking (especially since I am using the built-in iBook mike). Buying a headset would improve this. I wonder what is next. </p><p>And of course, it does worry me slightly where this is going. Certainly, having already a lot of friends around the world, email, IM and voip are very helpful. But I would love to have a larger percentage of my good friends in Toronto (or whichever city I happen to live), instead of spread out. Does the existence of these tools help us keep long-distance friendships alive, and thus spend less time on our local friends? Are we eventually going to go all global? Or perhaps it&#8217;s only me being weird.</p><p>Stian</p>",Brain drain,"development,economics,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/12/08/brain-drain/,"<p>I have written about information I found on brain drain, during my research for a thesis, <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/10/02/ethiopian-doctors/"">earlier</a>.

I originally came there to look at the <a href=http://www.newsdesigner.com/archives/002418.php>full page spread of King Kong</a>, which apparently caused quite a stir among the newspaper-design-aficionados. However, browing further down the site I came across <a href=http://www.newsdesigner.com/archives/002407.php>this frontpage from Polish newspapers, responding to a report by Amnesty</a> - they have decided to &#8220;censor&#8221; the frontpage (which is found in full on page three, page two is an analysis of the situation in Belarus). Of course, people are talking about newspapers&#8217; objectivity, and whether this is appropriate, but I think as long as newspapers are honest, and share all the facts, they are allowed to have an opinion. And if journalists don&#8217;t have an opinion on censorship on the press, then were are we going to wake up? So hurrah, Poland.

Ever notice how fun it is to watch TV when you&#8217;re in a different country? Granted, you might not understand everything going on, but it&#8217;s just so refreshing to see all new faces, and funny TV-shows. In Norway they sometimes have a program called &#8220;advertising from around the world&#8221; where they showcase the funniest advertisements from &#8230; you guessed it &#8230; around the world. And not only is it fun in itself, it also does reveal something about the different cultures; like the fact that half of the Finnish ads feature men in saunas (I lived there for three months, I know)&#8230;</p><p>So here is what I propose: in our burgeoning media jungle of 200+ channels, there should be space for the one true international TV channel. One that harvests the best, and the wackiest, the most romantic and the scariest from around the world; subtitles it, and shows it. I want to see an Italian drama series at 7, a Swedish cooking show at 7:30, a Mongolian gameshow at 8, and the Tanzanian traffic report at 8:30. At 9 comes the best - the primetime news, from a different country, and a different channel, every day! Not only would it be a lot of fun, but it might give us a little bit of insight into where other people live (might even make us curious enough to try to find Kazakhstan, where that soap opera was from, on the map). </p><p>Having spent the last week engrossed in a Chinese soap opera set in a university (Feichang Nusheng if you are curious - hilarious), I know how engaging yourself in a different TV world can bring new perspectives. Of course I am not proposing that all Americans are like Hollywood portrays them, or that one can learn all about Norway through getting NRK (the state channel) by satellite&#8230; but one can certainly learn <b>something</b>&#8230; </p><p>Let shows from a hundred tv-channels blossom.</p><p>Stian</p>",Trains in America? Amtrak to LA!,"personal,US,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2005/12/31/trains-in-america-amtrak-to-la/,"<p><img src=http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/travel/rail/images/amtrak-engine.jpg align=left/>I always loved trains, and I have taken my share of them, whether it&#8217;s the beautiful and comfortable intercity from my homecity Hamar to Oslo, the Norwegian capital, or doing the transsiberian from Moscow down to Beijing. In China I spent a lot of time on trains, and they are awesome; the train stations look like airports, with different waiting halls depending on which train you are taking, and the trains commonly carry over a 1000 people in sleepers; small moving villages. </p><p>But the US is not a country that one associates with trains; not anymore. Certainly, the great West was conquered by the laying of the railway (in which about 16,000 Chinese workers gave their lives), but today one flies, drives or if really wretched takes the Greyhound. However, there are still passenger trains going, and when we were planning our trip from Tucson to LA, we found a night train that was only 35$ one way (no student discount). Amazing. So we jumped on. The ticket was reserved online, and purchased at the station. (Nobody in Tucson knew that there was a train station in the city, let alone where it was - very different from Europe where the train station often defines the center of a city). We all lines up at the door, and had our tickets and IDs checked, and they did look through somebody&#8217;s luggage - there was an impressive array of security personell there. There was also a list of forbidden items, which included such things as small scissors and knives. Strange. Then again; in China they have X-ray scanners at all train stations (but I  have never seen anyone not getting through with their assorted bags of rubble).</p><p>The train was surprisingly comfortable, a double-decker with large seats that could slide out and provide a comfortable sleep. The personell was also very courteous and professional; quite unlike the Greyhound staff I usually encounter. Butterfly went straight to sleep, while I watched to episodes of Feichang Nusheng (a Chinese soap opera), and then drifted into dreamland as well. I woke up quite early, and looked out the window. To me, taking the train in the US was so foreign, that I frequently forgot that I was in the US at all; especially when we arrived at some station in a small town around 5 o&#8217;clock, and there was a long line of huddled individuals, with disheveled clothes and big bags waiting on the unpaved platform in front of the train - I could have sworn I was in China! </p><p>We made our way into the dining car, and although the it was slightly expensive (of course), and not very vegan friendly (I had some fruit), it is always nice having a good meal while hills are rolling past. We also met a nice retired professor from Alabama, and a high school student from Los Angeles. </p><p>Finally, we rolled lazily into LA; the greatest irony of it all: Arriving by train into the car-mecca of the world. The whole trip took about 10 hours, because of long waits at the different stations, and frequent stopping to let goods trains pass (I think they have single-track most of the way). But it was an altogether pleasant and cheap way of travelling, and I encourage more people to explore their options.</p><p>Stian, in Claremont, CA</p>",Christmas in Africa: Youth media and Linux in Chad,"africa,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2006/01/01/christmas-in-africa-youth-media-and-linux-in-chad/,"<p><a href=http://http://a13i.blogspot.com><img src=http://i2r.org/fmm/a13i/washing.jpg align=left height=225 length=300/></p><p></a>Two of my best friends are spending this Christmas in <a href=http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad>Chad</a>, helping a local youth organisation use open source software (<a href=http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>Linux</a>) and donated hardware to produce a youth newspaper.

Today I idly flipped through the 300 channels of our kind host in Idyllwild, after having checked that the float we visited for the Rosebowl made it through the rain. After checking out a few news programmes, a Spanish talk shows and some soaps, I happened upon UWTV&#8230; A guy lecturing a whole class room on epidemiology and quality-adjusted lifespan. Awesome - this is something I was studying with great interest last term in school, and it was great to see a different take on it.

For many years, they produced instructional programs, language teaching and so on - with accompanying booklets that could be bought for a small price. Now, they seem to have cut down on that a lot, and the programs are broadcast at 7AM on Sundays, if at all.

They also told us about SODEXHO - a French multinational which runs catering businesses in many countries, and even used to operate prisons in the US (but had to divest themselves of that investment, because of student protest). They run most of the food operations at St. George, UofT&#8217;s downtown campus, including the Robart&#8217;s library canteen. Apparently, the staff was paid incredibly low wages (chefs with 15 years ansiennity would be paid 8$/hr), and they were also harassed and discriminated against regularly.</p><p>I was briefly involved in a campaign to support the workers in their drive to unionize, but never participated much.

I am just researching an essay about Laos, a country I visited twice in the past. (Reading the history is very useful, and makes me realize that many of the judgments and assumptions I made about the country when I was there, were quite wrong). Either way, I have been telling my friends that Laos is so small and &#8220;underdeveloped&#8221; that it doesn&#8217;t even have a university. I thought I&#8217;d check, and it turns out I am wrong, it does have the Lao National University. It&#8217;s webcode ends in .la, and I thought: that&#8217;s neat, let me remember that.

One that stood out was a comparison between the US and Canadian university systems in terms of stratification and competition between undergraduate students. (The article was Davis, S. &#038; Hammack, F. M. (2005). The Channeling of Student Competition in Higher Education: Comparing Canada and the U.S. <i>Journal of Higher Education</i>, 76, 1, pp. 89-106. You can probably get it online through your university library, if you have one).</p><p>They start by stating that since enrollment in post-secondary education has risen dramatically in the last few years (around 60% of secondary school leavers in both countries visit some sort of post-secondary institution), the competition among undergraduates to attend the most prestigious program/institution has grown, but it manifests itself differently in the two countries. In the US, you have several thousand institutions, private and public, small and large; and there is a very clear hierarchy of the best schools, which is quite stable. If you compare today&#8217;s top-ten list with the one a hundred years ago, you will find only one change. These schools often charge very high tuition fees, but give grants and scholarships to attract the best students. Since it would be incongruent to have a very weak medical school at for example Harvard, these institutions try to maintain top quality across the board, and they do not charge significantly more or less for the different programs.</p><p>On the other hand you have Canada, with schools almost all public, and without clear perception of better and worse universities, at least for undergraduate. Partly because most students go to the closest university (which is true; at UofT we are constantly told about how excellent our university is, but most of the students I know grew up in Scarborough, not many people who travelled from BC or the Prairies to go to school here). The tuition fees across institutions is also quite similar, and regulated. However, the institutions are permitted to charge more (often quite a lot more) for certain programs, such as computer science, management and engineering. This has led these institutions to become highly sought after. The difference with the US is thus that in the US, which institution you attended is paramount, whereas in Canada, it&#8217;s which program you graduated from. In fact, people attending good institutions that fail to enroll in their program of choice might drop-out, and choose to do the same program in community college instead, something one would not see very often in the US. </p><p>Finally, they posit that because most of the best students from Canada go on to British and US elite institutions, this has functioned as a &#8220;safety valve&#8221; to the demand of setting up more elite institutions in Canada. </p><p>This whole discussion was valuable to me, because in Norway we also have universities that are very roughly &#8220;equal&#8221;; all funded 100% by the state (no tuition money), very centrally run, and if you want to study history it depends more on which city you want to live in. And although we don&#8217;t differentiate the tuition fee, if you want to study history as an undergraduate you are almost guaranteed admittance, but if you want to study journalism, law or medicine, it&#8217;s incredibly hard. </p><p>Stian<br />(picture by <a href=http://flickr.com/photos/roba>Roobee</a>)</p>","Administrator => Hi Eric, nice to see that you are reading my blog.

This is reassuring to someone like myself, who has been all over the place. I finally picked up her book &#8220;Whose Education for All, the Recolonization of the African Mind&#8221;, and I loved it.</p><p>The book starts out by criticizing the international consensus on &#8220;Education for all&#8221;, as shifting significant resources within developing countries from higher education to primary education. Part of the impetus for this is a World Bank study that showed that primary education had a much higher ROI (return on investment) than any other form of education. This study has later been challenged on purely economical terms, but Brock-Utne also asks us to consider whether return on investment is the only measurement of education; it is a very utilitarian view, seeing education as a tool to achieve a goal (development), rather than as a goal in itself (as in, people have the right to education). </p><p>Why she considers higher education becomes apparent in the subsequent sectors, where she discusses what is actually taught in elementary schools in Africa. The history of their school systems in most cases began with colonization, and this has left an important legacy, compounded by the current system of inequalities in the world. During colonialism, children were taught about English geography and French history (depending on their colonizers), and not of their own countries or regions. They were also taught <i>in</i> French, English or Portuguese, often from the very first year of schooling. This is something that has to a large part continued, due to many factors. The teachers at the takeover were already trained in teaching through a foreign language, there wasn&#8217;t the necessary vocabulary in the indigenous languages, there were to many indigenous languages to be accomodated by a school system, there was no local capacity to provide school books, etc.</p><p>All these statements are disproven both in her book, and in several other books I have read on linguistics, language policy etc. The fact that none of the universities in Africa today, except for in the Arabic countries in the North, use an African language in teaching courses is staggering (this does not include courses in indigenous literature and language, which are taught in for example kiSwahili in Tanzania). The lack of research on countries&#8217; histories, culture and language leads to a little girl taking a multiple choice test (how appropriate is that to traditional African forms of learning?) in English (not the native language of more than a few percentages in her country, and a language that not even her teacher speaks well), asking her about the &#8220;discoverer&#8221; of a certain waterfall. She is given four options, all European males, and she chooses the fifth - &#8220;None of the above&#8221;. And despite the fact that her family has lived in a village by that waterfall for many generations, her test comes back with a big red mark - wrong.</p><p>Brock-Utne makes a compelling case for how African education systems are failing African youth through provision of inadequate and inappropriate knowledge through a language that is poorly mastered. When performing poorly in international standardized tests, the language issue is seldom taken into consideration. While many studies show very significant impacts on learning, international donors often press for the continuing use of colonial languages, and both the British Council and the Alliance Francaise lead an almost neo-colonial policy of donating equipment and textbooks on the condition that courses be taught in their languages, even at the first levels of primary schools. </p><p>The book is well written, easily read, with a wealth of ideas and sources, I noted down quite a few. Sometimes during my reading, I would get so upset that I would almost destroy the book, because ideas of linguistic equality or justice are dear to my heart, and the arrogance showed over and over by the &#8220;international donor community&#8221; was mindboggling, if sadly not surprising. After reading this book, I was even more interested in the issues of African education, especially higher education, and language politics in general. </p><p>Before reading this book, I was familiar with the colonizing origins of the Alliance Francais from a book by John DeFrancis on development of a written language in Vietnam (which started out using Chinese characters). Recently, I have also read books about the use in education (or lack thereof) of kiSwahili in Tanzania, about language politics after the fall of the wall in the Central Asian republics, an article on the &#8220;re-Arabization of the Maghreb countries&#8221;, and lately I have been reading a number of books/articles on the history of Chinese and Russian education. All highly exciting stuff (to me), and something that reaffirms my desire to study international and comparative education.</p><p>Stian, in Buffalo</p>",Amazing pictures of high-density in Hong Kong,"asia,canada,toronto,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2006/03/14/amazing-pictures-of-high-density-in-hong-kong/,"<p><img src=http://www.spaceandculture.org/wolf_hongkong.jpg align=right/>I came across an interesting collection of <a href=http://www.photomichaelwolf.com/hongkongarchitecture>photos of high-density housing in Hong Kong</a> (thank you, <a href=http://spacing.ca/wire/?p=616>Spacing Toronto</a>), some very aesthetic pictures. I haven&#8217;t spend much time in Hong Kong, and don&#8217;t understand the city as I wish I did, but these pictures made me think of something. When discussing the past, present and future of Toronto, the issue of density is omnipresent; personally I am a big fan of higher density in general, for many reasons. It provides access to services, cultures and amenities in an easily accessible, walkable climate that is easy to serve efficiently with public transit. It also reduces the amount of agricultural or forested land that is paved over. However, many would point to the coldness of the towers at Bay street, and contrast them with the nice houses that line many of Toronto&#8217;s downtown streets, their obvious point being that they don&#8217;t want to live in a cold city.</p><p>Yet, what struck me is that there are few cities as &#8220;in your face&#8221; and &#8220;hot&#8221;, with a bustling, teeming life on street level that can be quite exhausting when you first arrive. I am not suggesting turning Toronto into Hong Kong right away (then again&#8230;), but perhaps this provides a different model of densification than do the corporate offices on Bay street, and the condos on Front street.</p><p>Stian</p>","Karen T => I&#039;m not sure this amount of high-density development would fly quite so easily, nor in a same trajectory in a North American environment. There is an idiosyncratic cultural propinquity of Chinese which allow for a *relatively* crimeless co-existence. For example the long-running de-facto political anarchy of the historical Kowloon City in Hong Kong points to a more unified and articulated social conscience which prevented it from collapsing upon itself. It was demolished out of Crown interest of political stability.The long and arduous process of fostering and buttressing community consciousness would be crucial creating a STRONG sense of civicism, which is loaded with contradictive tensions in the face of individualism, absolute privacy, economic self-interest but political apathy en-masse. Otherwise you get the sort of efficient (which is arguable in itself) and &#039;cold&#039; Bay St development you mention, transferred into residential zones.The economic and political problem is certainly cultural..

Although I realize that it is a very useful discipline, and I have read a number of very good and interesting works of ethnography (for example Golden Arches East, which I should do a write-up of here), there was often something that just grated me the wrong way.</p><p>I tried formulating this in my class on Tourism, environment and development - a geography class, although many of the readings and classes employ anthropological perspectives. One of our assignments was to analyze a tourist brochure critically; to write about the &#8220;tourist gaze&#8221;, the &#8220;othering&#8221;, and the colonial perspectives that are assumed to be omnipresent. During my research, I read a number of critiques of tourist descriptions, some of which I found quite inane. One quoted the reports from a backpacker in Central Asia to a newspaper, talking about bustling markets, women dressed in colorful headscarfs and selling handicrafts etc; a report that I could have made myself when I was visiting exactly the same area. However, this was attacked by the author, who complained that the &#8220;colorful women&#8221; were caught in capitalist infrastructures that forced them to work at that market, that by describing them in this way without individual voices he was marginalizing them and what not. I thought the author was exaggerating quite a bit.</p><p>Now, I am doing research for a medical anthropology course on Chinese immigrants&#8217; perceptions of healthy foods, and I was just reading &#8220;Pilaf, pozole and pad thai&#8221;, edited by Sherrie A. Inness, and the article &#8220;Let&#8217;s Cook Thai&#8221; by Lisa Heldke. Heldke analyzes the concept of ethnic cooking (by &#8220;White Americans&#8221;) as an almost colonial practice, where we continue to assert our dominance and exoticize the other. Not only that, she also discusses the case of Claudia Roden and her book &#8220;A Book of Middle Eastern Food&#8221;, the result of &#8220;anthropological studies&#8221; in Middle Eastern food cultures. The bone of contemption is that Roden takes utmost care to cite written sources that she bases her work on, but the numerous women that she interviewed are only introduced as profiles, and sometimes not at all. As she says: <i>&#8220;She [Roden] tells &#8220;colorful&#8221; stories about some of them in the body of the book, but the reader can match their names to their stories (or their recipes) in only a few cases - and then only with assiduous detective work.&#8221;</i> (p. 185)</p><p><img src=http://houshuang.org/blog/files/platecucumber.jpg align=right/>Whether this is a valid critique or not, I will leave to you. I am initially hesitant, especially because I could easily imagine an &#8220;all-American cookbook&#8221; with recipes from the Wild West with plenty of objectified cowboys and housewifes in just the same style. However, the question I asked in my tourism class, and which was perhaps not entirely comprehended (I might have had problems wording it) was: Is there a &#8220;good tourism ad&#8221;? Similarily, we could ask &#8220;Is there a good kind of ethnic cookbook?&#8221; Because for me there are two alternatives. Either the researchers/critics must unequivocally state that tourism / tourism advertising and ethnic cookbooks / eating ethnic food is wrong, and should not happen. Or they must be able to tell us how we <b>should</b> do this. I want my tourism teacher to tell me how an ideal tourism ad would look, one that did not other, or exoticize, lumpt together, or &#8220;gaze&#8221; in any way. One that was beyond reproach. Similarily I want Heldke to show me an ideal ethnic cookbook.</p><p>Heldke does give us some pointers in the final pages, stating that the women that contributed their recipes should have been informed about the use of their work, and perphas have been involved in a real collaborative effort. She also lauds community fund-raising cookbooks, where multiple members contribute similar dishes, but with subtle differences. I applaud the beginning of something constructive, but much more is needed. I wish that more social and cultural critics would step out of their usually negative positions, and start envisaging <b>very concretely</b> improvements. Only in this way can things improve. After all, that is the idea, the reasons, for critiquing things in the first place, right? Not merely the joy of showing intellectuall prowess?</p><p>Within the erotic film genre there have been some very good examples of this; people who say &#8220;We are very unhappy with the erotic material available today, but we don&#8217;t think that depictions of naked people are wrong in principle.

It bills itself as a &#8220;social commandline for the web&#8221;, and it&#8217;s pretty neat. Let me explain. Not many people know that browsers like Firefox have the opportunity to create web shortcuts (through the bookmark menu), so for example if you often go to Wikipedia to search for something, you could make the shortcut wp, which would enable you to type</p><p><i>wp ruby on rails</i></p><p>which would perform the Wikipedia search, and take you to that page. This is a big timesaver, however trying to figure out how to make web bookmarks for various sites is a major pain, and it&#8217;s also stupid to keep reinventing the wheel. So the idea with YubNub is that you can create a commmand, and make it public, and let everyone else use it. Then they took it further, and let people build on each others commands. It&#8217;s pretty cool.</p><p>You can either go to <a href=http://www.yubnub.org>Yubnub.org</a> and run commands from there directly, or there are many ways of <a href=http://www.yubnub.org/documentation/describe_installation>&#8220;installing&#8221; yubnub in your browser</a>, depending on which browser you are using. For example, in my browser (<a href=http://www.caminobrowser.org>Camino</a>), I can type &#8220;y (yubnub command)&#8221; in my address field, and it does what it&#8217;s supposed to. For example &#8220;y wp norway&#8221; will give me the Wikipedia page for Norway. &#8220;y gimyim cars&#8221; will split my browser window in two, and show hits from Google Images search on cars on one side, and hits from Yahoo Images on the other. &#8220;y fccca eiffel tower&#8221; searches for <a href=""http://www.creativecommons.org"">Creative Commons</a> licensed pictures on Flickr. And so on.</p><p>And today I made my humble contribution to the command list. I had planned to try doing this for a week or so, but had a major essay to finish first. Now you can use <b>utcat</b> to search the <b><a href=""http://main.library.utoronto.ca"">University of Toronto library</a></b> for keywords or authors, and <b>uttitle</b> to search for book titles. Combine this with &#8220;y gs efficiency&#8221; which searches <a href=http://scholar.google.com>Google Scholar</a>, and you are ready to do research for that paper! (And don&#8217;t forget y gmt norway for when you need to call your family.)</p><p>(Note that in listing my favorite commands, I prefixed them with a &#8220;y&#8221; - this is because that is my particular way of invoking YubNub, you might put it in your search-engine field, without a prefix, or use another method to invoke it. See the installation guide linked to above).</p><p>This whole concept fits well into what I remember telling Wojciech about the reason I love Google so much: It resembles a command line. Granted, graphical systems are great, but the commandline is so much faster sometimes. Before, to get a currency quote, I had to go to xe.com, and choose &#8220;list more currencies&#8221;, and then find NOK and CAD on long drop-down lists. Now, I can do the following in Google &#8220;(230 *1.15) CAD / lb in NOK / kg&#8221;, which takes a price in Candian pounds, adds 15% taxes, and gives me the Norwegian price in kilos. Brilliant. And so much faster. An interesting point is that when speech-input to computers takes off, in a way, parsing them will resemble parsing a commandline.</p><p>Stian<br /><i><a href=http://www.nivi.com/blog/article/rss-is-the-tcpip-of-web-20-ii-yubnub/>YubNub as a distributed operating system for the web<br /><a href=http://yubnub.blogspot.com/2006/03/yubnub-is-rewiring-my-thought-paths.html>How YubNub can make you rewire your brain patterns</a><br /><a href=http://nivi.com/blog/article/my-first-yubnub-command>A really weird command - search the digits of PI</a><br /><a href=http://www.genuinevc.com/archives/2005/09/thinking_about.htm>Genuine VC does some higher level thinking about YubNub</a></i></p>",Chinese politicians on the internet: Fu Rong,"asia,media,politics,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2006/03/26/chinese-politicians-on-the-internet-fu-rong/,"<p><img src=http://houshuang.org/blog/files/china_ill.jpg align=left/><a href=http://www.zonaeuropa.com/weblog.htm>EastSouthWestNorth</a> has long been among my favorite blogs about China, providing real insights into the media and internet world by posting long translations of newspaper articles, forum postings and the like. That&#8217;s where I got the story of Fu Rong, the mayor of Lingao in <a href=http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan>Hainan</a>, who logged on to one of the most popular discussion sites in China, <a href=http://www.tianya.cn>Tianya</a> under his real name, and started to communicate with the users. At first they were shocked, and refused to believe that he was who he said he was, but the forum called his office and confirmed that it was him. He even left a cell phone number, inviting people to call him with ideas and suggestions. Since then, there have been many discussion threads in the forum, and the users have treated him surprisingly &#8220;civilized&#8221; while he was finding his ropes in the internet world.

Many of the delegates (about 3000 if memory serves me right) to the conference were blogging, and often the comment sections had hundres of comments. How sincere the attempt to engage with the citizens is, is of course debatable, and I am not raving about this as some great democratization.

PizzaHut is extremely expensive in China, similar to a 7-course fancy restaurant in the west (compared to income), and they clearly wanted to make the best out of it. We got two salad plates that we could put as much as we wanted on, but we could only fill them once. I went first, and put a bunch of stuff (I thought), but my friends at the table were not too convinced. They then sent a delegation of Chinese students, and they built a whole structure on the plate to get more salad. They however, were dwarfed by these thrifty students from Taiwan (courtesy of <a href=http://www.start.com.my/blog/maximizing-your-roi-at-pizza-hut/#more-421>blewtooth</a>) that made salad-tower-building into a new art form. </p><p>I also remember that getting a cheese-less pizza (being a vegan) was not easy, the waitress completely refused, but I relented, and finally she went to ask the chef.

Funny, given that I routinely bought cheeseless pizzas at PizzaHut in Sweden, with no hubbub.

I have been working a lot on a website funded by CIDA, which has to be bi-lingual, French and English. The pages use PHP, and I ran into a lot of problems trying to reconcile French letters and PHP. I googled around, thinking that surely these problems would be well documented, but I didn&#8217;t find a very good comprehensive resource - maybe because it&#8217;s only available in French. However, I thought I&#8217;d gather some of my experiences here, to save other folks time.</p><p>First, just getting the French onto the website; if you cut and paste French accented letters, they&#8217;ll look horrible. If you save the file as unicode, they will look fine, BUT: PHP will crash! PHP is apparently incredibly backwards when it comes to unicode (come on guys, it&#8217;s 2006! 26 letters is not enough anymore, and hasn&#8217;t been for like 20 years&#8230;) The solution is to turn the page into so-called <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_entities>html-entities</a>, for example to get &rsquo;, you need to write &OElig;. Of course, changing this manually is a real pain, especially if you like editing your pages in a text-editor for maximum control. I wrote a little sed-script that does this automatically, download it <a href=files/french.sed>here</a>.</p><p>The way to use it is to finish editing your file, say french.php, and run<br /><i>sed -f french.sed french.php > out</i><br />and then<br /><i>cp out french.php</i></p><p>This assumes that you are running a UNIX-based system (including Mac OSX). If not, you can upload french.sed to your server, and run it there (if you have shell access). Sed is just a simple program that is included in most UNIX distributions, and french.sed is a simple file containing which search-and-replace operations to be conducted. Just a few lines, but I&#8217;ve used it a lot, and is highly useful.</p><p>For sending emails in French from a php-script, you need another method; <a href=http://wikipedia.org/wiki/quoted-printable>quoted-printable</a>. This looks like this: =F4, and you can use <a href=http://www.motobit.com/util/quoted-printable-encoder.aspthis webservice</a> to transform any text to quoted printable. If you have a lot of text, you can of course construct a similar sed script, or I even think php has a built-in function. Either way, it did the job for me. In addition, you need to add a few e-mail headers. I figured this out simply by typing in letters with French accents in Gmail, mailing it to myself, and then using Show original (very useful!). Here is an example of a code piece that sends a French e-mail from php:</p><p><i>if ($Language==&#8221;French&#8221;) mail($Email,&#8221;Merci&#8221;,&#8221;Nous vous remercions pour votre inscription pour participer =E0 la Semaine d&#8217;Action Mondiale 2006 de la Campagne Mondiale pour l&#8217;=C9ducation.

First, <a href=""http://china.notspecial.org/"">The Opposite End of China</a> mentions <a href=""http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/03/23/PM200603233.html"">a report from the NPR</a> that there is now a high demand for rabbis in China. The reason - China produces so many food items for consumption in the US that have to be marked as certified kosher, certified by a rabbi. It remains to be seen whether <a href=""http://www.cnhubei.com/200601/ca989059.htm"">the Blue Sky bar in Wuhan</a> will add rabbis to their eclectic clientele of young foreign English teachers, middle-aged French Citroën workers, African students on state scholarships and young Chinese couples.</p><p>The same weblog reports on <a href=""http://china.notspecial.org/archives/2006/03/why_is_chinas_w.html"">the wild web in China</a>, where cadres at all levels download homework assignments in ideological subjects, as well as &#8220;self-criticisms&#8221; that they can then modify and hand in to their party officials.</p><p>Finally, the owner of this very neat weblog from Xinjiang brings us some examples of <a href=""http://china.notspecial.org/archives/2006/04/uyghur_pop_and.html"">real Uyghur music, and &#8220;fake minority music&#8221;</a>.

Scott","books,development,economics,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2006/04/10/seeing-like-a-state-by-james-c-scott/,"<p><em>Note, this post is based on a book review I wrote for school. It&#8217;s a very good book, and I wanted to share some of the main topics. I cut down about 40%, especially my own analyses (which were tenous at best). This is my first attempt at posting something not written originally for the blog, we&#8217;ll see how it works out. </em></p><p>What does an Indian state capital, Waldsterben in Germany and the introduction of monocropping in Tanzania have in common? According to James C. Scott&#8217;s book &#8220;Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed&#8221; (1999) these cases are all examples of &#8220;high modernism&#8221; gone awry. They also illustrate the breadth of examples and cases that Scott attempts to, and mostly succeeds in, tying together into a central and convincing narrative. He began his enquiry into the workings of the modern state through asking himself why migratory people were seen to be such threats to all states, often coerced into becoming sedentary - and he ends up with the idea of a state that is trying to read society, but in trying to impose legibility, changes the very fundament of social and physical organization.<br /><span id=""more-96""></span></p><p>In accordance with the title, Scott (1999) wants to examine the grand failed schemes of development, and he does this through the conceptual lens of what he terms &#8220;high modernism&#8221;. This over-confidence in science and technology and the belief in a rational design of the social order was almost omnipresent in heydays of industrialization and well into our days &#8212; &#8220;It would have been hard not to have been a modernist of some stripe at the end of the nineteenth century in the West&#8221; (p. 4; 90) &#8212; but it became especially dangerous when coupled with an authoritarian state willing to use coercive power, a nation weakened by colonial rule, war, depression or national liberation struggle, and a weak civil society (p. 2-4).</p><p>But the grand schemes of development must be seen in the context of several hundred years of states struggling to make nature and society &#8220;legible&#8221;. Scott describes states that, a few hundred years ago, knew very little about their subjects, and the natural systems in the Kingdom. They used very heavy-handed techniques to extract what they needed for warfare and upkeep, and otherwise interfered minimally in local communities that they knew little about (p. 24). Scott uses the example of Bruges in the 15th Century as a city whose streets and houses were the result of millions of micro-interactions throughout history. Although their internal logic was obvious to the locals, an outsider would need a local guide to get around; not only would the streets be confusing, but the local dialect would be incomprehensible, the measures and even the &#8220;time zone&#8221; would be different for each locale (p. 56-65). And with no birth register, and no fixed last names, nor property registers to sort out the &#8220;chaos&#8221; (from the state&#8217;s point of view) of common land, shared land, leases and smallholdings, the state did not reach very far (ibid.).</p><p>The phenomenon that Scott describes, and that places cadastral mapping (who owns what land), language unification and utopian plans for city reform into the same conceptual category, is that in the process of attempting to &#8220;read&#8221; nature and society, the state ended up imposing a &#8220;simplification&#8221; of the structure, to make them more &#8220;legible&#8221; (p. 3; 15). Scott traces this back to the creation of scientific forest management in Germany, turning rich but difficult to manage ecosystems into regimented rows of Norway spruce was a way of making the forest &#8220;legible&#8221;, just as fixed patronyms and cadastral mapping were essential for taxation (p. 33; 70). The unification of language, and the city with wide streets and same-sized blocks enabled the expansion of the state&#8217;s synoptic vision, and the development of a more finely tuned, efficient and intrusive state (p. 81). This went hand in hand with the idea that a central purpose of the state was the improvement of all members of society, including health and education (p. 91).</p><p>Perhaps it was only natural that the extension of the &#8220;cameral science&#8221;, managing the wealth of the nation, would be the scientific management of men and women. Taylorism, the scientific management of labor, was equally attractive to the Soviet Union as it was to the capitalist West, both of whom liked to think of &#8220;masses of people&#8221; rather than societies of individuals (p. 140; 160-165). Not only does he highlight how workers are considered only as productive forces (like nature suddenly became natural resources, and plants were separated into weeds and crops), but he also underlines the process of turning skilled and autonomous smallholders and artisans into nameless, replaceable worker bees (p. 13; 176).</p><p>There are two related trends that run through both the utopian projected and actually built cities by amongst others Le Corbusier, and the grandiose agricultural reforms and villagization projects that Scott (1999) goes on to discuss. The first is a sense of aesthetics, and the idea, contested by Jane Jacobs, that if it looks organized, then it is organized (p. 104; 107). Thus, a road is seen, in Le Corbusier&#8217;s imaginary cities, as merely a tool to transport people from A to B, without recognizing with Jane Jacobs, that some might be traveling merely to enjoy the sights, some are taking a walk to their friends while doing some shopping at the same time (Scott 1999, p. 133). Jane Jacobs similarly criticized the &#8220;view from afar&#8221; of aesthetic modernists, and examined how people in the cities function.</p><p>Thus Brasilia and Chandigarh where both constructed with wide-open spaces, identical looking houses and with uses separated into different sectors of the city (p. 120). These cities undoubtedly looked very organized, compared to the hodgepodge of new and old buildings, mixed uses and labyrinthine roads &#8220;jarring&#8221; older cities in both countries. Similarly, the mono-crop planted fields in Tanzania were more appealing, and more clearly the result of hard work, then the polycrop fields that looked almost untouched (p. 282). Of course, to the insider the &#8220;system&#8221; in the old way was obvious, and much more sophisticated than from-scratch planning could ever create, but high modernism saw everything from the outside. Whether it was Le Corbusier drawing cities that would look hideous from everywhere, except from a helicopter looking down, or agricultural extension experts performing experiments with single crops under controlled conditions, that had no relation to the daily life of farmer, they all served to devalue and remove local knowledge, and impose an external perspective as the only valid (104; 262).</p><p>Of course, most of these schemes ultimately failed, and Scott believes their epistemology was the biggest problem. Modeling and generalizing can be useful conceptual tools, but if you begin to believe that the map is the terrain, you will have problems. Both ecological systems and social relations are infinitely more complex than what can be modeled, and in this case the planners often did not even try, or want, to understand local conditions. Scott calls the kind of knowledge which was devalued by the modernists, and in some instances totally destroyed, metis, the practical and implicit knowledge that comes with doing something &#8212; that is highly spatially and temporally delineated. It works right here, right now. It is highly local, and not explicit; not easily written down or &#8220;proven&#8221; according to positivistic science, thus does not &#8220;exist&#8221; within the modernist worldview. The processes of high modernism, whether it be factory industrialization, creating of huge factory farming in the US and Soviet, mass relocation of farmers in Tanzania or the introduction of mono-crop farming, all serves to create the &#8220;docile minds&#8221; of people once autonomous, now dependent on experts&#8217; advice.</p><p>Stian<br /><em> </em></p><ul><li><em><a href=""http://www.clubtroppo.com.au/2006/01/21/green-all-the-way-through""></a>Club Troppo discusses the &#8220;conservative approach&#8221; favored in Seeing Like a State and whether environmental conservation is a &#8220;conservative&#8221; cause </em></li><li><em><a href=""http://www.nehrlich.com/blog/2005/12/28/incomplete-realities""></a>Eric Nehrlich asks the question &#8220;Can we show that one reality is better than another?

Quicktime.</i></p><p>I came across <a href=http://images.apple.com/movies/fineline/theyearoftheyao/theyearoftheyao_320.mov>this documentary on Yao Ming</a>, the Chinese NBA player that has made, and found it quite interesting. I knew that Yao Ming was an important role model to Chinese in the US and in China who feel that Chinese males are often depicted as emasculated and not masculine (and short!), but I did not know much more (not being crazy about any sports probably didn&#8217;t help).</p><p>The movie tells the tale of Yao Ming&#8217;s first arrival in the US, playing for the Houston Rockets, lacking English skills and having a difficult time adjusting. The second protagonist is Colin Pine, the white guy who almost went to law school before he landed the gig of becoming Yao Ming&#8217;s personal interpreter, even moving in with him and his family for the first half year. The movie focuses a lot on the interaction between the two of them, and I found it fascinating, as you don&#8217;t often see white guys speaking Chinese on film, and here is one doing it on CNN live during press conferences and what not. It&#8217;s interesting that they chose to hire him, and not a Chinese-American who spoke both Chinese and English as their native language - you would think it would be easy to find one - and I am wondering if it was a conscious choice, that Colin would be better at the role as a cultural interpreter. But that is an interesting statement, given that they could have hired an Asian who had lived all their life in the US&#8230; </p><p>I also found the different repercussions of Yao Ming&#8217;s &#8220;Chinese-ness&#8221; interesting - in NBA he represents something rather novel, and so there were racial slurs by Shaquille O&#8217;Neal, lion dancing and Chinese acrobatics in the stadium before a match&#8230; How does this represent the culture that Yao Ming actually grew up in - I can only imagine if I were a famous basketball player from Norway, and every time I went to play a match, they would have tradition Norwegian dancers playing the fiddle and dancing in the stadium. I would not exactly feel &#8220;at home&#8221;&#8230;</p><p>Stian</p>","Down, up, and move: Tales of DNS woes","personal,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2006/04/24/down-up-and-move-tales-of-dns-woes/,"<p>I know this happens to people all the time, I remember my friend Leylop had huge problems migrating her domain from one host to another, when the first one wouldn&#8217;t release it. So I was up - a few days ago, someone told me that they got a page advertising real estate when they went to my page. I checked, and yes, apparently my domain had lapsed. I thought the U-HS guys I were hosting with had been quite negligent in not informing me up-front (I guess we&#8217;ve become kind of used to that kind of hand-holding), and I was a bit annoyed with them. Took about 18 hours before they answered my first ticket too. In the meantime, I knew I would be looking for a better host because my one year contract was about to expire, and I&#8217;d just set my girlfriend up with 1&#038;1, where she got several gigabytes of space (at U-HS I think I had 50, or 100). I spent some time looking around, and decided on Site5.com, even though it was slightly more expensive than I wanted; but then I get not only ssh-access (which is so useful) and Ruby on Rails hosting (I haven&#8217;t written anything yet, but if I want to&#8230;), and a lot of other neat stuff. Plus five gigabytes of storage, unlimited subdomains, etc. </p><p>To make a long story short, it took a number of emails with U-HS, and finally I got them to give me free DNS hosting for a year because of the miss, which is very fair (after all, my site is not a critical business site or something - I don&#8217;t think the world really minded it&#8217;s absence), and I migrated to Site5.com. The migration was surprisingly easy, tar all your files, upload them here and untar them (thank god for ssh here, although cpanel did help me backup my files at U-HS), export my mysql, change a few lines near the top with username and password info, reimport, and everything <b>just works</b>! Nice. (And I upgraded to WordPress 2.0.2 a few weeks ago, so everything is indeed cutting-edge. Now I just have to write interesting and inspired posts. Hm&#8230;)</p><p>Otherwise - exams until the 29th, and in mid-May I am probably leaving for Indonesia for a year, working for CARE Canada. Trying to learn Indonesian right now. <b><i>Kucing yang berwarna hitam sedang duduk di atas kacamata anak laki-laki</b></i>. </p><p>Stian</p>",Screencast: Wenlin helps you read Chinese,"china,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2006/05/02/screencast-wenlin-helps-you-read-chinese/,"<p><img src=""http://wenlin.com/wenlin.gif"" align=""left"" />I had studied Chinese for about two and a half years when I finally discovered Wenlin - not a minute too soon. The program is hard to define to those who have not used it, it allows you to load in a Chinese text (by entry, copy+paste or loading a file) and just by moving your mouse over the characters, it displays the dictionary definitions both of the phrases, and of the individual characters. You can then drill down and look up character etymologies, lists of all characters with this component, all phrases containing this character, etc. The strength of the program is</p><ul><li>the amazing dictionary, based on the <a href=""http://www.chinesestudies.hawaii.edu/abc/%3Cbr""></a> ABC dictionary by John DeFrancis at Hawaii University, which has almost every word you would want to look up. (My Chinese friend used this software when she was reading a hundred year old materials for her history class).</li><li>And the ease of looking up. Any student of Chinese knows that trying to find a character whose pronunciation is unknown is a veritable endeavour - you have to identify its radical (and they change appearance) and count the number of lines, etc.</li></ul><p>Thus Wenlin enables you to read texts &#8220;above&#8221; your level - for me reading newspaper articles would be frustrating because there were too many words that were important to the article, but that I would not run into often (like &#8220;apartheid&#8221;, &#8220;ambassador&#8221;, etc). Wenlin let&#8217;s you quickly lookup these almost without slowing down your reading. Thus you can advance from reading what your teacher prepared (John is a foreign student. He is in Beijing. Beijing is nice. John is American. Hi John.) to real material (A report of the 26th State Council of Copyright Protection).</p><p>As I stated above, trying to explain what Wenlin is and does is very hard, and so it is ideally suited to the new trend of doing screencasts - small movies - of software. I tried my hand at it, and here are some very short videos of Wenlin in action.</p><ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/files/WenlinDemo.mov"">Wenlin Demo in QuickTime (better quality)</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/files/WenlinDemo.avi"">Wenlin Demo in avi format</a></li></ul><p>(This was my first attempt, so it&#8217;s not perfect.

However, it can only look up one word at a time, and is quite slow. Seeing it as they very nicely provided a download of the entire dictionary, in html format, I started to play around. I was supposed to study for my political science exam, but instead I cooked up this: <a href=""http://reganmian.net/indonesian"">Terbang Dengan Bahasa Indonesia</a>, a little webservice where you can input a text in Indonesian, and it will return it to you marked-up version, where hovering your mouse over any of the words recognized (color-marked) gives you a pop-down with dictionary information.

Bell who works as a professor of political thought at Tsinghua University in Beijing, one of the most prestigious universities in the country. Having also tough in Singapore, he offers some very interesting perspectives.</p><p>He writes about the problems he encountered in the one-party state of Singapore, where his teaching contract was not renewed, and compares with China: <i>&#8220;In comparison, China is a paradise of academic freedom. Among colleagues, anything goes (in Singapore, most local colleagues were very guarded when dealing with foreigners). Academic publications are surprisingly free: there aren&rsquo;t any personal attacks on leaders or open calls for multiparty rule, but particular policies, such as the household registry system, which limits internal mobility, are subject to severe criticism. [...] More surprisingly, perhaps, I was not given any explicit (or implicit, as far as I could tell) guidance regarding what I could teach at Tsinghua. My course proposals have been approved as submitted.&#8221;</i></p><p>He mentions topics that he has discussed in class, such as humanitarian interventions, and how they are linked to Chinese national politics. His students <i>&#8220;are no slouches: it&rsquo;s probably harder to be admitted, statistically speaking, into Tsinghua and Beijing University than into leading American universities. My students are supposed to be leaders of society: I&rsquo;m told that the Communist Party student members at Tsinghua prepare the educational curriculum for all the young Communists in China. They are intellectually confident and often well versed in the Chinese and Anglo-American (if not French and German) philosophical traditions.&#8221;</i> </p><p><a href=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=418>Go read it</a>. Although he teaches mainly in English, he has a deep appreciation for Chinese culture, as well as his own subject. He was clearly hired because of his standing in the field, not because he was a foreigner who was willing to go to China (which was the case in my example). I continue to be interested in foreigners teaching in Chinese universities, especially when they do it in Chinese, which for example Ruth Hayhoe has done at several occasions.</p><p>Stian<br /><i>Here is a paper written by Bell:<br /><a href=http://www.asianbarometer.org/newenglish/publications/workingpapers/no.26.pdf>Do Asian Values Deter Popular Support for Democracy</a></i></p>","Lovely University of Toronto campus, a walk-through","canada,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2006/05/10/lovely-university-of-toronto-campus-a-walk-through/,"<p>During the making of a little homevideo project, I did some shots of the University of Toronto, both downtown and Scarborough.

The script uses 7zip to selectively uncompress only the files needed (it unpacks a few css files etc at the beginning), keeps a cache of all files already read, and implements an internal webserver (Webrick) which can be viewed at http://localhost:2000/wiki. Currently it is very unfinished, but still quite useable. I am putting it out there for people to try - and I think it could become a great tool with some help (especially with 7zip).</p><p>## THE PROBLEM WITH 7ZIP<br />The wikipedia-(language version)-html.7z is a compressed files that contains all the individual html files (generated from the Wikipedia sql) that make up a language wiki. This can run up to hundreds of thousands of files (or millions for the bigger Wikis). If we uncompressed these to the harddrive, they would take up very much space, both because they are big, and because there is a very large amount of small files, that still take up on block (depending on file system). We want to be able to use the 7zip file directly. Currently I use the off-the-shelf 7zip decompressor, but it&#8217;s slow. It was not optimized for finding one file within 100,000. Depending on your computer, on my 2 year old iBook it can take up to 14 seconds to locate one file from the Norwegian Wikipedia. This is independent of my script.</p><p>Proposed solution: I am quite sure that it would be easy (a few hours) to use the freely available source code for 7zip to implement a small tool that indexes a 7zip compressed file (writes all the filenames, and their offsets, in a separate file). If we then modified the uncompressor so that it reads the offset from this file, and not by going through the entire file from start to finish, I think we could get the time to uncompress down to almost nothing. This would radically improve the useability of this project (and might be useful for other projects too). My problem is that I know nothing of C, and I don&#8217;t really have the time to learn. I would REALLY really appreciate some help here!!</p><p>## LIMITATIONS (UPDATE)<br />It seems that using links that have non-ASCII characters (including the last three in the Norwegian alphabet) do not work at all on Mac or Windows (could be my sh setup that is bad), but has been reported to work on Linux. Does this suck insanely? YES! Is it easy to fix? Not necessarily, because I need to get the unicode characters correctly from the webbrowser, to the webserver, through the commandline, to the 7zip commandline utility. This is obviously a high priority for me, also because it renders the Chinese stuff completely unusable. Note that it can display articles with unicode perfectly, just cannot deal with the filenames.</p><p>Second limitation: No installation routine&#8230; But I&#8217;ll give you some hints.</p><p>## INSTALLATION<br />Nothing to it really, but you need a few things. Ruby and 7zip. After that, you should be able to run ruby wiki-html.rb from within the directory where the file resides, and if there are any &#8220;wikipedia-*-html.7z&#8221; files present it will work. Use a web browser (I assume you can figure out how to download a web browser) to view http://localhost:2000/wiki and it will either show a list of available wikis (afterwards available through http;//localhost:2000/wiki_list), or if there is only one wiki dump file present, it will display the start page for that wiki. Happy surfing (but be prepared to be patient).</p><p>## GETTING RUBY<br />If you are on Windows, and have not installed Ruby, do it now. The easiest is the One-click installer at<br />http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/</p><p>## OTHER PROGRAMS<br />You also need 7zip. If you are on Mac, download p7zip from Sourceforge here:<br />http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/</p><p>If you are on Linux, your package manager should have it, or you might have it installed already (try typing 7z or 7za in a shell window).</p><p>Note that the WikiServer expects you to have a program called 7za in the path. If you are on a PC, locate the executable 7z.exe in the 7zip folder in Program Files (or equivalent), and copy it to the path, or to the directory you are launching WikiServer from.</p><p>On Mac and Linux, the ruby executable should already be in the path. If you are on a PC, you can add the ruby directory to your path, or just copy the source files you just got from me (and 7za) into the ruby/bin directory, and launch from there. (A messy, but simple solution if you want to try this out).</p><p>## GETTING DUMP FILES<br />Static HTML dumps, needed by the server, can be downloaded from http://static.wikipedia.org/. Currently the last is from November, but the December dump is in progress. Click on the Download link, choose your language, and download the filename ending in .7z. These should be in the same directory as the server files.</p><p>## THE WAY FORWARD<br />In addition to making this an easy to use way of viewing Wikipedia offline for Windows, Linux and Mac, I am also planning to make CD/DVD distributions that contain all the necessary programs (7zip, Ruby etc), and can run directly off the CD. (Ideally, I&#8217;d get the guys who sell pirated DVDs on street-corners in Indonesia to start hawking legal Wikipedia!). Before I start doing any of that though, I need to get the 7zip issue sorted out.</p><p>For someone with another approach to packaging Wikipedia, have a look at the MoulinWiki: http://www.moulinwiki.org/.</p><p>## FEEDBACK, BUGS<br />Any feedback is welcome. This is very new, in progress, has barely been tested on other computers than my own (Mac and PC), and might very well not run on other configurations. Paste the output and email to me. Thanks.</p><p>## THANKS<br />Thanks a lot to Liam Doherty and Espen Beer-Prydz for helping me test the first version and giving me feedback on instructions on different platforms. Keep testing it guys!</p><p>Stian, Jakarta, 2007 - shaklev@gmail.com</p></blockquote><p><a href=""http://houshuang.org/blog/wikiserver-021.zip"">Download the Wikiserver</a><br />Stian</p>",OpenEd: Week 1,"development,India,open-education,personal,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2007/08/31/opened-week-1/,"<p><a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/shaklev/PositiveDevianceTrainingCARE/photo#4995277895239467026""><img align=left src=""http://lh6.google.com/shaklev/RVLKx5QcABI/AAAAAAAAAUc/c1LBHsNOH1U/s288/DSC02174.JPG"" /></a><b>QUESTIONS: In your opinion, is the &#8220;right to education&#8221; a basic human right? Why or why not? In your opinion, is open *access* to free, high-quality educational opportunity sufficient, or is it necessary to *mandate* education through a certain age or level?</b></p><p>I was excited to enter this course, because in addition to being very passionate about the topic, I was also interested in the method of teaching/taking the class. If I want to understand what different methods of distance/open education work, I cannot just read about other people&#8217;s experience, I need to try it out myself. And this first week of the course has been very interesting - while the readings themselves were rather dull, they did provide a good background and &#8220;common base&#8221;, but it was the comments from my fellow students that sent me off reading, and made me both remember old ideas I&#8217;ve had myself, and made me explore new thoughts. In a way, I actually feel closer to my students in this class, than most of the ones sitting next to me in a hundred-person lecture theatre at University of Toronto, because there all we do is listen to the same lecturer drone on, and then we go home and study for the exam. Here we share our reflections, based on our own ideas and previous experiences, which makes the learning experience much more interesting and personal.</p><p>It also makes it much harder for me to answer this week&#8217;s questions. After reading the allotted readings, I was going to give quite standard answers, however after reading other people&#8217;s answers and thinking, it became much more complex. The two Tomasevski readings stated three things very clearly, that primary education should be free of charge, compulsory and not exclude anyone. It then went on to discuss the legal and economical obstacles, spending very time problematizing what was meant by primary education. Many problems were touched upon in a summary matter, but not explored further - I think they are very much worth exploring however. </p><p><img src=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Hindi_Mahastotra.jpg/250px-Hindi_Mahastotra.jpg align=left><b>Language of education/local content</b><br />If we first accept the idea that for children to attend an institution that is a &#8220;primary school&#8221; is generally a good thing, then there are still a number of things I wanted to comment. First of all, the matter of language of education is essential, and it is only briefly touched upon in Tomasevski. <a href=http://folk.uio.no/bbrock/>Birgit Brock-Utne</a> has dealt extensively with this topic in her great book <a href=http://www.franklin.com/estore/dictionary/BBT020390365XDLDA/>Whose Education for All, the recolonisation of the African mind</a>, and in numerous articles. She is very sceptical to many of the thoughts propounded in Tomasevski&#8217;s article, and contained in the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_For_All>Jomtien agreement</a>. Education is far from neutral, and when it is conducted in a foreign language, and with a curriculum that has no relation to the local people&#8217;s situation, it can be downright damaging. She gives the example of a little girl who has a multiple choice test (I hate multiple choice!) being asked which of these four French guys first discovered a given waterfall. She answered E, none of the above, because her family had lived by that waterfall for several hundred years. She got an F. </p><p>Brock-Utne&#8217;s argument is that you cannot just start by funding only primary schools, and then later switch to universities, because who will teach in the primary schools? Who will develop the text books in local languages, highlighting local knowledge, understandings of history, society and politics? Without all these, the primary education is not much worth. (She also comments that many of the literacy surveys of international organizations actually only measure literacy in the colonial language, whereas the rate in the local languages might be much higher). (Talking about languages, I have to share <a href=http://thornwood.peelschools.org/Dual/about.htm>this link to what an elementary school in multicultural Minnesauga, Canada is doing</a> - it&#8217;s a wonderful approach, making all the students feel really welcome - like assets and not burdens - and enrichening all the other students. I wish I could be a student/teacher at that school!)</p><p><img src=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/id/thumb/1/15/Denias_Senandung_Di_Atas_Awan.jpg/200px-Denias_Senandung_Di_Atas_Awan.jpg align=right><b>The right to refuse?</b><br /><a href=http://gregfrancom.blogspot.com/2007/08/right-to-education.html>Greg Francom</a> makes an interesting point about &#8220;the right to refuse&#8221; for for example indigenous people. I think this is a very interesting point, and I have two examples. When I was in Laos, I joined an organized walking tour into an indigenous community. They lived a day&#8217;s walk from the nearest road, only a few people spoke Lao, and they had nothing modern in the entire village. There was no clocks, no school, no hospital, no institutions. They all worked together, played together and took care of the children together. Perhaps it is these children&#8217;s right to receive an education, but then you would have to construct roads into this community, and by doing that you would destroy them - the children would grow up in a completely different culture from what their parents had, and this would tear the society apart. (Because of incredible corruption and greed in Laos, this happened - many indigenous communities were forcefully moved down from the hills to the valleys, because the government wants to exploit rubber plantations and power plans. They will probably end up with many of the same problems that indigenous people face around the world - alcoholism, family violence&#8230;)</p><p>I also wanted to mention <a href=http://www.deniasmovie.com/trailer_eng.html>an interesting movie that I watched in Indonesia, called Denias</a>. It was very beautifully filmed, about a boy in an isolated village in Papua (the Indonesian part - also called Irian Jaya) who went to a tiny school taught by a teacher from Jawa who came by helicopter to live in their village. It portrays the teacher and also the resident military officer as heroes, and the father who is reluctant to have his son attend class, and rather wants him to help in the fields as at worst egoistical and at best ignorant and backwards. The school children beg the teacher to provide them with uniforms, and finally they get airlifted in some uniforms donated from Jawa. Then the teacher has to leave, and to pursue further education, Denias leaves his village and family and goes to the big mining town, where he finally manages to beg himself to a space at the fancy school for elite children, taught by fair skinned Jawanese. </p><p><a href=http://afeministblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/denias-senandung-di-atas-awan.html>AFeministBlog</a> refers to the following conversation, and uses it as an example of how the indigenous don&#8217;t realize &#8220;what is good for them&#8221; <i><br /><block><br />Maleo: I need your help to make Denias able to study again.<br />Samuel: Don&rsquo;t interfere my affair. That is not your duty.<br />Maleo: I know this is not my duty but your duty.<br />Samuel: This is not Java. All sons have to help their parents. You don&rsquo;t understand that.<br />Maleo: I understand that. That&rsquo;s why Denias has to study. If he studies, he will be able to help you a lot later.<br />Samuel: That&rsquo;s it. You only can say later later and later. What I need is now now and now.<br /></block></i><br />However, in the film&#8217;s &#8220;postscript&#8221; it is revealed that Denias later gained a full scholarship from the mining corporation to go study in Australia, and that he is now living in Australia. So - what benefit has his schooling brought to his parents, to his village? </p><p>These were a few comments based on the idea that primary schooling as it is realized today is mainly good - with some important changes (it should be accessible in the local language, teaching a relevant local curriculum, maybe it&#8217;s not appropriate for indigenous people etc). However, what if we change tack, and state that schooling is actually negative?</p><p><img src= http://lh3.google.com/shaklev/RtipRbiqB9E/AAAAAAAABG8/rXG7RZ7qKb8/s160-c/Blog.jpg align=right><b>An alternative to schooling?</b><br />When I was younger, I often discussed education at length with my friends, and the system we came up with was strikingly similar to Ivan Illich&#8217;s thoughts, which I was only to read many years later in <a href=http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Illich/Deschooling/intro.html>Deschooling Society (whole text available online)</a>. He is very sceptical to institutions which tell you how you should learn and stifles creativity and curiosity in children - instead of a compulsory number of years of education that is separate from everything else and conducted by professionals, he proposes a much more flexible system where pupils learn what they want to, from each others and from elders in society who want to teach, while at the same time contributing to society. I always thought that there was nothing intrinsically wrong with children working - I loved coming to my father&#8217;s work when I was young, and helping him with different things, it taught me much about society and made me feel valuable. It is forcing children to do demeaning and dangerous work that is wrong. </p><p><a href=http://iamarf.blogspot.com/2007/08/open-ed-week-1.html>Andreas Formiconi</a> brought me a link to the Indian organization <a href=http://www.swaraj.org/shikshantar/>Shikshantar - The People&#8217;s Institute for Rethinking Education and Development</a>, that had quite a few writings very critical to the culture of schooling. Here is an excerpt from <a href=http://www.swaraj.org/shikshantar/cultureofschooling.html>their list of critiques of &#8220;the Culture of Schooling&#8221;</a>:<br /><block><i><br />1)  Labels, ranks and sorts human beings. It creates a rigid social hierarchy consisting of a small elite class of &lsquo;highly educated&rsquo; and a large lower class of &lsquo;failures&rsquo; and &lsquo;illiterates&rsquo;, based on levels of school achievement.<br />5)  Confines the motivation for learning to examinations, certificates and jobs. It suppresses all non-school motivations to learn and kills all desire to engage in critical self-evaluation. It centralizes control over the human learning process into the State-Market nexus, taking power away from individuals and communities.<br />7)  Fragments and compartmentalizes knowledge, human beings and the natural world.  It de-links knowledge from wisdom, practical experiences and specific contexts.<br />9)  Privileges literacy (in a few elite languages) over all other forms of human expression and creation. It drives people to distrust their local languages. It prioritizes newspapers, textbooks, television as the only reliable sources of information. These forms of State-Market controlled media cannot be questioned by the general public.<br />10) Reduces the spaces and opportunities for &lsquo;valid&rsquo; human learning by demanding that they all be funneled through a centrally-controlled institution. It creates artificial divisions between learning and home, work, play, spirituality.<br />12) Breaks intergenerational bonds of family and community and increases people&rsquo;s dependency on the Nation-State and Government, on Science and Technology, and on the Market for livelihood and identity.<br /></block><br /></i>In their different documents, Shikshantar echo many earlier writers who have criticized institutional and state-run education. </p><p><img src=http://farm1.static.flickr.com/37/81425899_ff6abae8a2_m.jpg align=right><b>Credentials are wrong?</b><br />Shikshantar also started a movement to <a href=http://www.swaraj.org/shikshantar/healingdiplomadisease.pdf>stop using diplomas to assess people&#8217;s value</a>, and encourage people and organizations to worry less about credentials and grades, and use more holistic means of assessment. While this sounds great, it does remind me of the <a href=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/10/10/051010crat_atlarge>history of College admissions in the US</a> which tells us that enrollment based on pure academic merit led to enrolment of Jews at Harvard in the 1920&#8217;s reaching 20%. Pure antisemitism then led the College administration to come up with new ways of keeping Jews out of their school, and they ended up with an &#8220;all-rounded&#8221; evaluation, where you would write application essays, submit references etc. Now they could turn away the students that had scored the best (and were Jews) because of non-measurable factors. I cannot help but think that today&#8217;s equivalent is the middle class kid who has spent a gap-year in India, and worked for a whole summer as an unpaid intern with the UN in New York, versus the working class kid who has worked equally hard and gotten equally good grades, but couldn&#8217;t afford to do an unpaid internship, and had to work at McDonald&#8217;s instead. Who do you think will get the job?</p><p>These are important readings, because it is so easy to take schooling for an unequivalent good thing. Indeed, I remember reading an article saying that when literacy activists went into an area to teach literacy, they produced illiterates. Before, there were no illiterates, only people. With skills, stories, social roles. Then suddenly, they were &#8220;made&#8221; illiterate by these external forces, which defined them as lacking. This is not to say that literacy (in your mother tongue) cannot be a huge bonus, but we need to be <b>far more</b> sensitive to the possible negative consequences of schooling. <i>I believe that some readings that highlighted these ideas should be included in the reading list to balance off the overly positive view of schooling expoused by Tomasevski.</i> </p><p><b>Conclusion?</b><br />I have muddied the waters enough, and I need to answer the questions. The first one is easy, yes I do believe that the right to education is a human right - it is what enables to to realize what it is to be human, and it is what enables us to realize many other human rights, like political participation. However I do not think that education and schools are synonymous. I do believe that ideally a child can receive a perfectly good education outside of the standard school system - learning from her elders, from her peers, exploring the world around her and creating meaning. That is an idealized picture, and it might be that a number of years of decent quality institutional elementary school is all we can hope for in some countries. But we should never leave that uncontested as the final ideal.</p><p>Stian<br />(Diploma photo (cc) <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124455441@N01/81425899/>blue_j @ flickr.com</a>)</p>","Nana Podungge => I happen to find this post of yours from &#039;VIEW MY STATS&#039; machine in my blog.

To me, this was a real treat. Although I don&#8217;t enjoy every singly Bollywood movie (how could I, when they produce over 900 per year?), I seem to me more receptive to them than many others. In Jakarta, I found a theatre owned by an Indian family, that often showed the latest Indian movie, and that provided perfect escape from reality - I also saw some really great movies, like Dhoom:2, Lage Raho Munna Bhai and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna. I have been enjoying watching the movies this summer with my mother (it is fun to share such a moment with her). Movies I really enjoyed were Dhoom, Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. and Mohabbatein. </p><p>Tonight I saw that they were showing Fanaa - a movie I saw during my first month in Jakarta and really loved. It&#8217;s a crazy movie, almost like two movies turned into one - after about 1,5 hours it completely changes from docile love-story to high-octane terrorist thriller&#8230; and back. Only Bollywood, I tell you, only Bollywood. </p><p><img src=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/16/City_of_Men.jpg/200px-City_of_Men.jpg align=left>Of course, for me it is extra fun because I have some small ambitions of eventually learning Hindi. So I enjoy trying to pick up words and phrases when they speak (this probably annoys my mother quite a bit). I am incredibly happy though, that Norway has a state television that dares to show foreign films from around the world (with no advertising of course). Yesterday we watched a German film on NRK1 (<a href=http://www.br-online.de/kultur-szene/film/kino/0409/03603/>Agnes und seine Bruder</a>) which was also quite good. And most days, there is a French movie, a Spanish movie, a Danish&#8230; NRK2 even had a Brazilian soap this summer (<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Men>City of Men</a>) which was great - since I am kind of planning to learn Portuguese as well.</p><p>Norway might be a lot less multi-cultural than Toronto, and we have problems with integration and xenophobia. But I love things like this. And of course I am still waiting for them to recognize the world&#8217;s biggest film industry: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nollywood>Nollywood</a>!</p><p>Stian</p>",Political TV debates in Norway,"europe,media,politics,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2007/09/10/political-tv-debates-in-norway/,"<p><img align=left src=http://nrk.no/contentfile/file/1.3383510!img3383496.jpg>In a few days Norwegians will vote for local and county representatives, and of course the newspapers and TV channels are full of debates and analysis. Today I watched the equivalent of a town hall meeting with mostly representatives from the national parties in Northern Norway on our state television channel (<a href=http://nrk.no/nyheter/innenriks/valg/val_2007/1.3383452>link in Norwegian</a>). The first thing that sprung to my mind was the problem of having national politicians dominate what are city and county elections - this is not a new thought, it has regularly been decried by both media and politicians themselves. However, the problem is that we only have national TV stations in Norway, and they need to cover the debates as well. I would love to have attended some of the political debates in <a href=http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamar>my town</a>, but either I was working, or I forgot about it, or I was tired after a long day at work and didn\t bother biking downtown the site where the debate was held. </p><p>So how can the state television channel, which has a mandate to report objectively and widely on this election campaign, contribute to my finding out more about my local political debate? How about they sent someone to the local debate to film the whole thing, and they put it up on Google Video? (It&#8217;s fine if they choose to put it up on their own site, but please let it be for download and not just for streaming!). I would actually be quite happy to watch an hour debate if I could choose the time myself, because so far I have only read newspaper reports of what the politicians say, or politicians&#8217; own letters to the newspapers&#8217; debate pages etc, but not actually seen them debating each other. Of course, we wouldn&#8217;t need NRK to do this, we could just show up ourselves with a video camera, getting written permission from all the participants (and if some refused to sign, we&#8217;d go to the local newspaper and have them make a big deal out of it) to put this up. Ideally, we&#8217;d put it up under a permissive <a href=http://creativecommons.org>Creative Commons</a> license, which is <a href=http://www.thedailybackground.com/2007/05/05/cnn-plans-to-release-upcoming-debate-footage-uncopyrighted/>admirably done</a> by CNN for the current presidential debates in the US. </p><p>However, apart from the issue of local versus national, I also thought a bit about the whole format. The debate was about climate issues, and the nice thing was that every single political party, except the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_Party_%28Norway%29>Progress Party</a>, a populistic right-wing party that has a worrying amount of votes, were busy hitting each other over the head with how much more they would do for the climate. I think this has really shifted in the last few years - seeing the Conservatives standing there attacking Labour for not being radical enough, and challenging them to double their support for alternative energy research was neat. So I guess the ideas war has been won - but putting things into practice, things that might even hurt some people&#8217;s living standards or jobs, will be a whole other ball game. So instead of choosing to support the candidate that said more collective transportation, instead of the candidate that wanted more high ways, you have a row of six parties all wanting more collective transportation, and to choose whom to vote for you have to examine previous voting patterns, individual cases and plans, etc.</p><p><img src=http://farm1.static.flickr.com/4/5164339_9e85b7a74c_m.jpg align=left>So I was also thinking of how we could make the debates - whether live or asynchronous - more informative and enlightening, in the face of TV hosts who often just want to play up the personal conflicts, to get more viewers. A typical event is a politician citing a fact or an event, that the other politician disagrees about, with the host saying &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s not get into the whole numbers game - let&#8217;s move on&#8221;&#8230; But when it comes to numbers and facts - they can actually be objectively proven. So what if for example the debate was not live, but pre-taped, and fact checkers then went out and checked out each statement by the candidates (during our presidency pollution was reduced by 20%), etc, and then inserted those details into the final broadcast? Or what if we could create a massively tagged and commented version of the debate transcript - using <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing>crowd-sourcing</a> to look up references, link to statistics and analysis etc. <a href=http://www.futureofthebook.org/commentpress/>CommentPress</a> is one example of how this might work, here is an example of <a href=http://www.futureofthebook.org/iraqspeech/address>a Bush speech marked up like this</a>.</p><p><img src=http://www.webshotspro.com/gd/show.php/267x200/screenshots/90c18da649bec05cecea8f818a27d22b.jpg align=left> Of course, in order to have things to link to, we&#8217;d need information and statistics on what politicians actually do in parliament. <a href=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/>TheyWorkForYou</a> in Britain is a really neat model. They digitalize the <a href=http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansard>Hansard</a> and do lot&#8217;s of neat things with it to extract information and statistics, so that you can look up a politician and see exactly how they&#8217;ve voted in different issues, what they&#8217;ve said etc. We need something like this for Norway too. </p><p>I could think of other ways of having more intelligent debates too - I&#8217;ve been learning a lot from innovative ways of doing it for example in the blogosphere. How about each politican preparing a brief, that people could read and comment upon and challenge. Then they&#8217;d meet for an online debate at a certain time, which would be transcribed, and then there would be a discussion of the transcript and further analysis later. I guess the biggest challenge is the partisanship - whether people would be willing to sit down for a serious discussion, and agree on certain facts, or whether they would automatically distrust everything anyone on the &#8220;other side&#8221; said&#8230; Perhaps this would be easier in Norway, with more political parties and less black-and-white than in the US. Perhaps one could even try this with political parties that are closer - ie. the Socialist Party and the Red Party debating, instead of the Socialist Party and the Progress Party. Not sure, but it would be interesting to try. While we long for those times mentioned in <a href=http://books.google.ca/books?id=KEzKAAAACAAJ&#038;dq=&#038;prev=http://books.google.ca/books?id=KEzKAAAACAAJ>Neil Postman&#8217;s Amusing Ourselves to Death</a>, where presidential candidates gave hours-long heavily argued speeches, and the public listened with rapt attention&#8230;</p><p>Stian<br />PS: I started writing this a few days ago, but only finished it today - the day of the elections.<br /><i>Image of empty parliament courtesy of <a href=http://flickr.com/photos/davemorris/>Dave Morris @ flickr.com</a></p>","marta => interesting paper.. interesting things the Chinese students noticed.. in a way I had no idea how much distraction there is to learning when you&#039;re not familiar with the system, I am so used to the north american education I just take it for granted.

What do they emphasize differently? What are the aims of the authors of each report? Do you see a bias toward or against any ideas, organizations, or approaches in any of the reports? Which report spoke the most clearly to you, and why do you think it did? Based on where the field is now, and these initial ideas about where it might go, what part of the open education movement is most interesting to you? Why?</strong></p><p>As mentioned below, I read these three reports one after another, and my impression was probably shaped both by exhaustion and the order in which they were read. There were very few concepts or projects that were new to me, which I guess means that I spend far too much time reading edubloggers, although as you can see in my notes below, I did pick up on some interesting concepts and frameworks. I got the most out of the first report, by <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_35845581_1_1_1_1_1,00.html"">CERI at OECD</a>, which provided a good outline of the field, and some interesting thoughts on sustainability, motivation both by individual professors and institutions, and financial costs/benefits. Although the second reading, from <a href=""http://www.olcos.org/"">OLCOS</a>, did introduce the concept of moving from user-contributor to collaborator, and emphasized different ways of learning and teaching, in general I found the report tedious, poorly organized and very repetitive (granted, it was not the people at OLCOS&#8217; fault that I had just read the CERI report hours before). Finally, the <a href=""http://www.oerderves.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/a-review-of-the-open-educational-resources-oer-movement_final.pdf"">Atkins, Brown and Hammond paper</a> for the <a href=""http://hewlett.org"">Hewlett Foundation</a> was nice in that it provided a very clear narrative arch, with a much more focused purpose than the two previous papers which were giving wide overviews of a field.</p><p><img src=""http://lh4.google.com/shaklev/RpET6y8Hu_I/AAAAAAAAA4U/xGlFsYXguhc/s288/%5BUNSET%5D"" align=""left"" height=""288"" width=""216"" />There are many topics to pick up on in these papers, and I will choose only a few. Open Courseware is the flagship of the OER movement, and MIT of course, is the flagship of the OCW movement. However, when reading the three different reports, and having spent substantial amounts of time on the MIT OCW and other OCW sites, I keep wondering if there is something I am missing&#8230; Granted that a few courses on MIT OCW offer video of whole lectures, or audio, but most offer very minimal information/content: a reading list (with mostly PDFs and books that are not freely available), a course outline, a few essay questions, if we are lucky some lecture notes in outline format - this is what is most often provided, and I seriously question the utility of it. <a href=""http://www.uio.no"">University of Oslo</a> has provided full course outlines for all their courses online for years, and they have never claimed to be doing OCW, in fact I have come to expect it, and was much annoyed when I realized that at <a href=""http://www.utoronto.ca"">University of Toronto</a>, one has to run around attending classes that one might be interested in during the first week, just to obtain course outlines.</p><p>Grand announcements are made about the impact of OCW, like for example this statement in the Atkins, Brown and Hammond paper: <em>&#8220;The ten lead universities [in China] use several hundred MIT OCW in their teaching programs. This has had a major impact on Chinese education.&#8221;</em> (p. 27) To say that something has had a major impact on Chinese education - spanning hundreds of universities which have very long histories, is a brazen statement - to say so without providing any source or evidence backing it up is poor science. I am very curious about the impact of OCW and how exactly people are using them, and at least MIT has been doing a lot of documentation work. I am planning to read both the <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/global/MITOCW_Case_Studies.pdf"">OCW Case Studies</a>, and the <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/NR/rdonlyres/FA49E066-B838-4985-B548-F85C40B538B8/0/05_Prog_Eval_Report_Final.pdf"">MIT OCW 2005 Final Evaluation Report</a> to gain a better understanding of both what is actually happening, and how MIT views its role, and how it evaluates the success of the endeavor.</p><p>I also wonder about the cost. It was stated in one of the papers that it costs MIT $25,000 to digitalize one course, and even with the best imagination, I cannot imagine how it would cost that much - especially for the sections that are just a few PDFs. I understand though, that one of the problems is having to clear a lot of the copyrighted material used in class - images and illustrations for example - this is a problem that the reports really brought home to me, and this is probably part of the reason why it&#8217;s costly for MIT, and why much of the material is not very exciting.</p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/405736544_99a9f76d47_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""180"" width=""240"" />So I would love for MIT to provide full video of all their lectures - if not for anything else, it wold be interesting to see how they teach, get some ideas - and I can clearly see how this can be useful to many people. However, if we are targeting self-taught learners (as opposed to providing material that other teachers can assess and incorporate into their classes), we need to really consider what their needs are. Indeed, I have been thinking a lot about university pedagogics in general, and trying to find a book that would explain to me the &#8220;dominant thinking&#8221; of university pedagogics. I know a lot of it is historical hubris, but I do hope that there would be some kind of educational theory that told us that &#8220;So, you want to give a few hundred 19 year olds a deeper understanding of American Civil Rights movements? Or the philosophy of Spinoza? Here&#8217;s the best way - they should meet a professor for about two hours a week, in a huge classroom, where they will mainly listen to a powerpoint-driven talk given. Then they might meet a tutor for an hour a week, in smaller groups, to discuss the topic, but mainly to ask about what is on the exam, and finally they will write a term paper, and an exam (multiple-choice of course).&#8221;</p><p>The scenario listed above is what currently happens in most undergraduate classes - what I&#8217;d like to know is how much of that is just &#8220;we&#8217;ve always done it like that&#8221;, how much is &#8220;we&#8217;d love to do it radically different if we had the money&#8221;, and how much is &#8220;it&#8217;s actually a decent way of teaching them&#8221;. Having searched for books on the basics of pedagogics, most of what I can find are alternative pedagogics, radical pedagogics, criticisms of the current system. But somehow I would like to start with a pedagogical description of the current system - before we start tearing it to pieces. And I think this applies to online distance education as well - I would like to really understand the methods that people use, both in formal distance-ed classes, but more specifically self-motivated independent learners. I had a quick look at the case studies provided by MIT, but they go nowhere near deep enough, they merely describe the externals of a Professor of Architecture in Indonesia, who used some courses from MIT to brush up. I&#8217;d like to know, exactly what materials in those courses did he use, and how did he use them. What other materials would he have appreciated?</p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/153/333371703_ad06523c00_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""180"" />That&#8217;s not to say that institutions shouldn&#8217;t release their material freely. Material that is produced anyway - lectures must be given and course outlines created, might as well be posted online, and with some help from work-study students to film the lectures, and cooperation from the lecturers in providing PDFs, this ought not be prohibitively expensive. Ideally then someone else could string together these elements into courses -the playlist university, both making it available for people to use whenever, and offering time-limited enrollment-like situations, like this very course (which could easily have featured lectures by professors at MIT School of Instructional Technology, if such a school had existed, as part of the &#8220;curriculum&#8221;), which value-adds by giving deadlines, a learning community, a shared process, and a mentor role. I like what Connexions are doing with their concept of <a href=""http://cnx.org/news/LensesIntroduced"">lenses</a>, and it would be great if they expanded that to include playlist courses, both for asynchronous use, but also for easy startup of time-based learning-community-based courses to start and end (and perhaps add to the course content as part of their process).</p><p>As I mentioned, I could discuss many other aspects of these writings, but some of them have been menti0ned already, and I might add others during the coming week. In closing, I want to say that to me the most interesting directions are on one hand pedagogics, both basic pedagogics, distance-ed, collaborative and constructive learning, etc. I know there is a lot of material on this, and I&#8217;ll just have to sit down and read - when I can find the time. The second is the production and use among non-English speaking countries, especially but not by far limited to developing countries&#8230; localizing content and language, and perhaps finding innovative offline or hybrid ways of utilizing the information in teaching and learning.</p><p>Stian<br /><em>(thanks to <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/ninefingers"">ninefingers @ flickr</a> for the Learn Checkers Fast photo, and <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/jiscinfonet"">jisc_infonet @ flickr</a> for the library photo)</em></p>",Reading MIT OCW Case Studies and Evaluation Report,,http://reganmian.net/blog/2007/09/27/reading-mit-ocw-case-studies-and-evaluation-report/,"<p>As noted in my OpenEd 4 submission, I really wanted to read the <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/global/MITOCW_Case_Studies.pdf"">MIT OCW Case Studies</a> and the <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/global/05_Prog_Eval_Report_Final.pdf"">MIT OCW Evaluation Report</a>, and today I finally found time. The Case Studies are easy to locate, but the evaluation report was actually quite hidden.</p><p>I had a look at the case studies before, and they are all pretty much glorious - not a single negative comment, so very much a piece of marketing. They are also not very specific, although most of them are about educators who adopt some of the material for their own class. The evaluation report is quite long, but it&#8217;s actually just a web site statistics printout, interspersed with comments, as well as some findings from interviews and surveys. If you wanted how many people from a specific domain accessed a specific subpage, while using Firefox version 2.0 on Linux - this is a goldmine. The qualitative data seemed rather haphazardly interspersed though, mostly to break up the statistics.</p><p>I would have liked to see references to more research - for example they mention that CORE is doing very impressive work in China, but with no reference - I would love to know more both about the translated MIT content is being used in Chinese universities, and about the impact and process of Chinese universities themselves publishing lectures. I found two interesting resources though.</p><p><img src=""http://worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/DCARead?standardNo=1599043017&amp;standardNoType=1"" align=""left"" height=""187"" width=""130"" />One is a book called <a href=""http://worldcat.org/oclc/68624107%3Cbr"">Globalized e-learning cultural challenges</a> by Andrea Edmundson, which contains an article by the Taiwanese translators of MIT OCW, talking about the process and challenges <a href=""http://www.myoops.org/"">OOPS</a> had in translating the MIT courses into Chinese, and a number of other articles that look interesting. I&#8217;ll order it on InterLibrary Loan, but have to wait a while, because I have a lot of books coming in for my thesis.</p><p>The other was a mention on the CORE website about a <a href=""http://www.core.org.cn/en/news/2007/070820.htm"">research competition</a>, giving grants to several students to do research on OCW and OER in China. The first batch is in, and will be published soon on the CORE website. I will be looking forward to reading these - wish there was somewhere I could sign up to be notified, since I might well forget to check back. They are also announcing new scholarships for people interested - if you know about anyone doing OER research in China, let them know.</p><p>Through the CORE website, I also came across an OER I haven&#8217;t seen mentioned in any of the readings - <a href=""http://www.pitt.edu/%7Esuper1""></a>SuperCourse, an OER resource on medical topics.</p><p>As for the things I took away from the evaluation, an interesting point was that although most lecturers were positive, a few were worried, either because a future book-deal might be imperiled, or because<br /><quote></quote></p><blockquote><p><quote> &#8220;I feel the need to make the material more polished for publication on OCW. I see this as a</quote><br /><quote> obstacle for rapid improvement of my lecture material.&#8221; (Music faculty)</quote><br /><quote></quote><quote>&#8220;Having highly polished course materials be the norm discourages innovation in thecurriculum.&#8221; (History faculty)</quote><br /><quote> </quote></p></blockquote><p>Reading all the case studies of different schools around the world incorporating the material into their classes - in some cases quite wholesale - also did make me a little bit uneasy about this &#8220;educational imperialism&#8221;. Sharing knowledge is great, but if that results in all the universities in the world becoming mirror copies of MIT, that&#8217;s a blow to diversity. In the report, they say that UNESCO&#8217;s OER conference concluded that MIT&#8217;s OCW would be a boost to local production of OCWs in universities around the world - and I guess the CORE example in China really holds this up. I&#8217;d love to see these different OCWs exchange information and resources - what about integrating the video lectures with <a href=""http://www.dotsub.com/"">dotsub</a> so that they can be collaboratively subtitled? I found a bunch of <a href=""http://www.archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&amp;mediatype=education&amp;collection=chinese_u_lectures"">Chinese video lectures</a> at <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-admin/archive.org"">archive.org</a>, including a whole series on <a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/humanities54"">Chinese Culture in Russia and France</a>. I am sure French people would be very interested in seeing the episode on China Fever in France in the 18th Century - a Chinese talking to Chinese about how Chinese were seen in France, how very meta.</p><p>One final thing I wanted, is to comment on something a teacher at MIT said about how MIT OCW allowed her an insight into what her colleagues were teaching, and through better understanding what they specifically taught in the math courses, she was able to relate it explicitly to her own engineering courses for her students. I&#8217;ve often thought about whether professors ever audit other professors&#8217; classes, whether because they want to learn, or because they are curious about the teaching style and what not. I suspect it&#8217;s rare, which is unfortunate. This goes into my whole argument about pedagogics and teaching in higher education - which is something I am constantly exploring, and might be writing more about.</p><p>Stian</p>","How to Get Six Pack Fast => Hey, nice tips.

I notice very clearly when browsing Chinese websites, for example, that they are a lot denser than what I am used to (of course, my lack of reading speed aggravates this feeling) - in class I gave the example of comparing <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk"">The Guardian</a>, an English newspaper, and the Chinese website of the <a href=""http://www.people.com.cn"">People&#8217;s Daily</a>, and the difference is quite striking. The Guardian chooses a few stories to feature, and gives us the headline, perhaps a small picture, and a few lines of ingress, while the People&#8217;s Daily just lists one headline after another - seemingly want to present a direct link to every single page on the whole site, on the front page. This is not an isolated example, and the same is true of other kinds of web pages, like the university website for <a href=""http://www.hust.edu.cn/"">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a> (华中科技大学).</p><p>After mentioning this to a friend, she gave me links to a few blogposts (<a href=""http://www.churbuck.com/wordpress/?p=540"">here</a>, and <a href=""http://www.virtual-china.org/2006/03/aesthetics_of_a.html"">here</a>) that referenced an <a href=""www.medien.uni-trier.de/fileadmin/bilder/mitarbeiter/bucher_chinese_internet-final-version.pdf"">academic study</a> by <a href=""http://medien.uni-trier.de/mitarbeiter/professoren/hans-juergen-bucher.html"">Hans-Jrgen Bucher</a> about how Chinese use the internet, and whether there is a &#8220;Chinese Internet&#8221;. He talks briefly about the discourse around the internet within China, how it is mostly used for fun (gaming, chatting) and how it is often mentioned as a menace to the young - the new opium (certainly I remember reading stories in the newspaper when I lived there, about girls who traveled to another city to meet their online love, and were abused, or of people spending forty hours straight in internet cafes, etc). He also looks at the design aesthetics, how Chinese both have the concept of &#8220;aesthetics of abundance&#8221; and &#8220;aesthetics of emptiness&#8221;:</p><blockquote><p><em>In Chinese culture we can find two different kinds  of aesthetical systems: the &ldquo;aesthetics of abundance&rdquo; and the &ldquo;aesthetics of emptiness&rdquo;  (see Pohl 2004). Websites in China are usually designed along the principles of the  &ldquo;aesthetics of abundance&rdquo; which refers to the Chinese popular culture and what can be  seen in New Years pictures, calendars or paintings on dishes. The &ldquo;aesthetics of  emptiness&rdquo; is part of the Chinese high culture and heavily influence by Zen and Chan  Buddhism. The principles of this kind of aesthetics did not influence web design up to  now in a significant way. The attractiveness of the &ldquo;aesthetics of abundance&rdquo; not only  relies on its integration into popular culture but also on its symbolic meanings: strong  and rich colour, density, and opulent presentation symbolize happiness and wealth.   </em></p></blockquote><p>Recently, a friend of mine forwarded a few links to different Web 2.0 sites in China that closely mirror the design of similar sites in the West:</p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.yo2.cn/"">http://www.yo2.cn/</a> (我的优博网) - <a href=""http://www.wordpress.com"">Wordpress</a></li><li><a href=""http://fanfou.com/"">http://fanfou.com/</a> (饭否) - <a href=""http://twitter.com"">Twitter</a></li><li><a href=""http://xiaonei.com/"">http://xiaonei.com/</a> (校内网) - <a href=""http://facebook.com"">Facebook</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.56.com"">http://www.56.com/</a> - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com"">Youtube</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.yupoo.com"">http://www.yupoo.com/</a> - <a href=""http://flickr.com"">Flickr</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.xianguo.com"">http://www.xianguo.com/</a> (鲜果) - <a href=""http://bloglines.com"">Bloglines</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.diglog.com"">http://www.diglog.com/</a> - <a href=""http://www.digg.com"">Digg</a></li></ul><p>So it will be interesting to see whether Chinese sites will start incorporating the Western clean, simple Web 2.0 aesthetics, or continue developing along their own path.

This also made me think about the problem with using RSS readers - although Google Reader is magical in allowing me to keep up to date with hundreds of different sources, easily share interesting postings with my friends etc, it hides the comments - and I fear that when reading the postings of my classmates in the Open Ed course for example, I miss out on part of the richness, unless I open each posting individually to read the comments. I also enjoyed the reading <a href=""http://learnonline.wordpress.com/2007/05/04/the-illogical-rhetoric-of-share-alike/"">The Illogical Rhetoric of Share-Alike</a>, which was linked to from one of the readings. (It&#8217;s interesting how blog posts are so much more a part of the &#8220;conversation&#8221; - when reading the huge tomes from UNESCO and OLCOS and the like, they stand alone as monoliths. Perhaps they cite other research findings and reports, but only occasionally am I so interested that I will go look them up. When reading blog posts though, there are a million jump-off points, and <img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1259/769925499_8327bb1cd9_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""180"" width=""240"" />I find myself tumbling through a many-faceted conversation, going far beyond our original &#8220;curriculum&#8221;. Indeed, the discourse and activity around OER is so broad, that I am still struggling to define my own &#8220;level of engagement&#8221; and very I fit in, where I can make a meaningful contribution - as a current undergraduate student, as a (hopefully) soon-to-be graduate student, as a teacher (formal and informal), learner, participant, activist, creator&#8230;</p><p>I have always been sceptical of the <u>CC NC</u> (non-commercial) license, as I also mentioned in the previous posting, but this week&#8217;s readings made me more skeptical towards the <u>CC SA</u> (share-alike) requirement as well. I mainly focused on the problem of license incompatibility, but in &#8220;The Illogical Rhetoric of Share-Alike&#8221; we are also introduced to the problems of universities and institutions of higher learning in considering to share major parts of their material with the world. Their main issue is not what other people might want to do with it, but that they themselves might be restricted from freely using the &#8220;improved&#8221; materials as they see fit - the example being designing a training program for a corporate client, incorporating material that they already had developed, or working with indigenous communities and incorporating material that they would not feel comfortable sharing. These are interesting issues, however I wonder if some of them might not be resolved by thinking that applying a Creative Commons license does not, as far as I understand, obligate you to distribute the material. So if a university was working with an indigenous community, using CC SA licensed material and material from the community, they would have to license all the material as CC SA, but if they only distributed it to the community in paper format, or on a closed learning site, nobody else would have access - whether it is CC licensed or not. I do realize the problem though, and I appreciate the people raising it.</p><p><strong><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/770790872_f3a06c0513_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""180"" width=""240"" />The need for another CC?</strong></p><p>As stated earlier, I believe that there should be a CC license that did not require attribution. That does not mean that you are not allowed to provide attribution, and indeed you probably would in normal use in academia - because that is how we do things. However, you would have the option of not providing attribution when that is problematic because of the medium. As far as I understand, the reason to use CC NC is not primarily to prevent people from making money off material, but rather to avoid that open material is &#8220;re-appropriated&#8221; by commercial entities. In this case, I believe SA does provide sufficient &#8220;protection&#8221; by making sure that all &#8220;value added&#8221; is returned to the community. There are many cases in which entrepreneurs and commercial entities can be very important both in adding value (as has been the case with open source!) and crucially in distributing the content.</p><p>Stian<br /><em>(thank you to <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/manannan_alias_fanch/"">Fanch the System @ flickr</a> for the great photos)</em></p>","OpenEd &#8211; week 7  Insegnare Apprendere Mutare => [...] but why are we obliged to pretend something, when giving our work away?

I found the project <a href=""http://boxroom.rubyforge.org/"">Boxroom</a>, a Ruby on Rails project that seemed to do pretty much what I wanted, and with a very simple and intuitive layout. I still missed a few functions, but it had a very clear code base, and so I spent part of my time at CARE adding functionality and making it more appropriate to our organization.</p><p><img src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/files/search-boxroom.png"" align=""left"" />The product right now has a lot of really neat features - it uses a number of UNIX tools to extract the text from pdfs, rtfs, powerpoints, etc - and full-text indexes all files, so that you can search with &#8220;snippet view&#8221;, you can preview the pure text (instead of having to download a 5 MB pdf, especially useful in countries with slow internet), upload zip files that are then extracted, or select a number of files and have them zipped before downloading, distribute permissions on a group basis, and there is even a very thin &#8220;intranet news&#8221; front-end, which is mainly to promote files, since it has a very neat way of linking directly to files in the repository.</p><p><img src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/files/news-boxroom.png"" align=""left"" height=""156"" width=""250"" />The application is almost 100%, but since my Ruby skills are not perfect, I do believe that there are still some tiny bugs or instabilities in there - the only real way to find out is to use it. However, because of other issues, we never managed to implement it at CARE before I left, and since then I have gone on to do other projects. I would very much like for these changes to be incorporated into the original Boxroom, so that they could face more &#8220;peer-review&#8221;, but unfortunately the original Boxroom is pretty much unmaintained at the moment. So instead of letting the code linger on my hard drive, I decided to at least release it to the public.

Indeed, it is strange that the early movers in this space have been large privately funded US institutions, and not the larger state-funded European universities, with mandates to serve the whole population (the Open University in the UK might be a good exception). When I was in China teaching in university, I used to boast about how in Norway even a street-sweeper (if we still had those), or a homeless person, could follow all the lectures of a given course for free (and legally - not by sneaking in), get a library card at the university library and check out all the books he or she wanted, etc. There is no reason why this shouldn&#8217;t be extended into the virtual space (as for access, luckily most Norwegian small cities have libraries that offer free access to the internet nowadays).</p><p>Talking about sustainable, it&#8217;s funny that just this week a discussion about this course should erupt, and we are asking if it is sustainable to offer this course for free - and we are told that our teacher (perhaps understandably) prioritizes the fee-paying students. I have commented a bit on this earlier, but one thing that I wanted to add is that we need to think about how this course can make a lasting contribution to the OER realm. I am very glad, upon checking the curriculum, that the last week of class is dedicated to reflection upon the course - I hope we can have a really good discussion about how this course was structured, what the motives or visions behind that structure were, to what extent they were fulfilled, and how the course could be better designed.</p><p>But in addition to that, a lot of the readings have talked about OERs not being something that is designed for learners, but is something that learners produce as a side-effect of the process of learning - so how has our participation in this class contributed to help the next learners on open education? What materials have we produced, assembled, gathered, translated, marked up, mashed up, personalized, modularized?</p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/97/205620757_c6bbe07589_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""158"" width=""240"" />There are many different aspects to sustainability, because there are many kinds of material. I think that by structuring their way of preparing material slightly differently, professors could make a lot of the material that they produce for class anyway public for very little cost (as mentioned earlier, University of Oslo puts all their curricula for all their classes online, and have never called that OER, only an obvious service to students). Ideally university professors could collaborate online, and by spending the same amount of time they now spend on creating question sets and overheads, they could create really valuable textbook-like resources.</p><p>However, &#8220;commons-based peer production&#8221; is also really valuable, and Wikipedia is of course an incredible OER in itself - not only as a stand-alone work, but as something that can be copied-and-pasted from, both in terms of text, and in terms of incredible illustrations that are all open to use (and won&#8217;t make your material non-distributable). Benkler makes a point in that it is not necessarily as easy to break up into small portions and distribute widely as Wikipedia, if we want more &#8220;coherent&#8221; pieces of work, but in a sense a lot of this is being created already today - people writing textbooks for their classes, or at least long articles&#8230; If we can just collect them all, make them available under open licenses, translate them, and have people use them actively - that might be a very good start. And I really like the system of &#8220;lenses&#8221; that Connexions provide, more so than absolute &#8220;peer-review&#8221; because material really useful to some learners, won&#8217;t be useful to others. This goes together with the idea of &#8220;playlist classes&#8221;.</p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/29/41530381_b0ee1fc36b_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""180"" width=""240"" />Finally (and I am talking to a large extent about higher education and further education for educated adults here, because that&#8217;s where a lot of my own thinking focuses), the movement for open access to academic research is really a movement for open OER as well - in a lot of my courses, all our readings are collections of articles. So perhaps then, at a university level, open education would consist of a selected (playlist/lense) collection of open access articles, plus a learning support community (like this class), with assignments, deadlines, feedback mechanisms, etc.</p><p>As for accreditation, I do think and hope that eventually society will become more flexible about accreditation, because right now it&#8217;s very coarse - one of the things mentioned in Jeff Rybak&#8217;s book <a href=""http://www.jeffrybak.ca/"">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with university - and how to make it work for you&#8221;</a> is the fact that most employers only look at your degree and not your grade. So all they see is &#8220;he/she did four years of schooling&#8221;. And for the top students, the only way to differentiate themselves is to do grad school &#8220;he/she did six years of higher ed, great&#8221;&#8230; With the incredible amount of options for learning autonomously and the need for continuous learning, and the eventual and necessary reform of university as an institution, this view could hopefully change. Until then, one interesting model is one that the Economist has been advocating (and unfortunately I cannot find the article in their archives - full-text search is failing me) of having world-class universities like Harvard or MIT separate their teaching arm from their evaluation arm. So that anyone in the world willing to pay a small administrative fee, could take a comprehensive Harvard exam, and if they passed, get a Harvard degree that was just as valid as any &#8220;Harvard&#8221; student.</p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/195/489310561_4c2363356a_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""180"" width=""240"" />The neat thing about this is that it would force the education arm to really compete on education, not on name recognition. Are Harvard students better, because they got a better education, or because Harvard just admits the best students? And it would mean that hyper-smart people that didn&#8217;t have the money or the connections to get a scholarship could use OERs and online communities of learners and scholars to gain the same amount of knowledge and insight, and receive recognition for it. (This is similar to what happens with the International Baccalaureate, which I did for my high school, and another side effect of this is that since the teacher is no longer evaluating you, and has no impact on your final grade, your roles change, and your teacher can become more of your partner, or accomplice. You both know the final goal, and hopefully your teacher can help you get there.)</p><p>Of course, one could argue that this would just lead to dumbed down cramming and MAs taken through multiple choice exams, but perhaps we could take this as a challenge to create a truly comprehensive and deep way of evaluation. In addition, one could argue that it would kill the autonomy that the professors have to create truly unique learning experiences, but in fact, what might be needed in higher education (especially at undergraduate level) is more peer-review of teaching, because too many professors take the academic freedom to teach what they want, as freedom to not give their best to students who couldn&#8217;t care less&#8230; And you can&#8217;t convince me that there is any reason that Econ 101 should be completely different, or expect completely different things from students across a lot of different universities (at least not in the same region/country).</p><p>Stian<br /><em>(thanks to <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/mgallacher/"">michael @ flickr</a> for the arches photo, <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/42476745@N00/205620757/"">Bond Sarah @ flickr</a> for the empty chairs photo, <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/roland/"">roland @ flickr</a> for the playlist photo</em> and <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/araswami/"">Swami Stream @ flickr</a> for the photo of Mumbai university)</p>","OpenEd: Week 9, Wikinomics",,http://reganmian.net/blog/2007/10/28/opened-week-9-wikinomics/,"<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Wikinomics-Mass-Collaboration-Changes-Everything/dp/1591841380/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-7721236-6845635?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1193626583&amp;sr=8-1""><img src=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M9MTN5QFL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,45,-64_OU01_AA240_SH20_.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""240"" /></a>It was interesting to note that I had already read most of the books listed by David Wiley on the curriculum page. I don&#8217;t know if that means I am very up to date, or that I am too quick to throw myself at all the &#8220;pop-social science best sellers&#8221; that are published? Either way, I hadn&#8217;t read Wikinomics yet, and a professor of mine said it wasn&#8217;t half bad, and generously lent it to me.</p><p>General impressions first; I wasn&#8217;t too impressed. Perhaps it&#8217;s partly that none of these ideas are particularly new to me (although some of the individual examples of how companies are using them were), and perhaps to someone who has never heard about Wikis, networking, collaboration, Web 2.0 etc, this could be a great book. However, it is very clearly a business book, written for executives, and with a language and writing style that I am not used to, and don&#8217;t particularly like. I remember thinking the same thing about <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Fortune-Bottom-Pyramid-Eradicating-Publishing/dp/0131877291/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-7721236-6845635?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1193626843&amp;sr=8-1"">The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid</a> by CK Prahalad, another book that I had been looking forward to reading. It is exuberantly optimistic, and provides a whirlstorm of &#8220;case studies&#8221; that have &#8220;revolutionized business&#8221;, but provides little in-depth analysis or comparison. The book will not be a good guide to those that are convinced about the merits of collaboration and opening up, on how to implement it - which is our situation (I am assuming).</p><p>That said, I was able to extract a few points that could be valuable.</p><ul><li><strong>Including for-profits</strong>: This book is written from the perspective of a for-profit looking out, but nevertheless it writes a lot about how for-profits should engage in the open movements, and how producing and adding to the various knowledge commons can benefit the company as well. I would argue that commercial companies have contributed significantly to the success of open source, and most open source licenses, certainly the GPL, have never been anti-commercial. With the best OERs in the world, we still agree that we sometimes need to have human involvement, whether in classroom instruction, as an online mentor (which can be very taxing, something that Professor Wiley has experienced in this course).<img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1119/1147753958_8e4aebff02_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""180"" />I think it would only be a healthy sign if a huge industry of training companies grew up around OERs, that provided value added services - like hands-on instruction, mentoring and guidance by distance, follow up and setting deadlines, printing textbooks or DVDs, etc. If they then released all their material back to the commons, whether because they were compelled (through CC share-alike) or as a goodwill gesture to the community, the whole movement would benefit. This is a strong argument against the CC NC license on educational material.<p><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1098/1147753948_9e62ec4d53_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""159"" />(One thing I am curious about is the reach of the share-alike, what exactly does a derivative product entail? If I wrote a book, and inserted a picture, that whole book would be CC as well because of SA? What if I put together a folder of educational material, and included a CC SAed brochure? Etc.)</p><p>An additional thought after reading about all these companies that opened up their internal processes to collaboration both from the internal staff, and from external customers, was the idea of a more open and flexible university. Some enlightened professors are great at engaging their students in defining the contents of the class, but generally both our programs of study (which courses we have to take to graduate), and the contents of them, are determined by individual faculty. Of course the over-worked, disengaged, GPA-chasing student body <img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1427/1190865232_d7fa1a3904_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""180"" />today does not make this easier, but that is partly a chicken-and-egg problem. I would love to see the process of undergraduate teaching become as studied, as discussed and as public as research - where plans, processes and results are posted publicly and discussed publicly, where professors sit in on each others classes and give each other fair advice and criticism, and where the whole academic community (including students) are involved in finding and promoting best practices (without homogenizing or taking away local autonomy).</li><li>He discusses the practice of several companies banding together to produce a product that is beneficial to all of them as &#8220;basic research&#8221;, and I think this process is very similar to the idea that many US universities go together to fund the production of open undergraduate textbooks, or initiatives such as the <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/"">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosphy</a>.</li><li>Finally, he mentions many examples of Web companies that open up their APIs and benefit from the incredible inventiveness and creativity of the community. I wonder if some of the Open Courseware repositories could do something to facilitate this, both by making the material itself easier to process (more XML/HTML and less PDF for example), and by providing open APIs so that people can access the material and present it in different ways.</li></ul><p>I guess my three points were a bit top-heavy, but it was difficult to find good insights since he focuses so much on what companies can do, hopefully the above is somewhat useful.</p><p><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1339/1190865246_82c93568ab_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""183"" />I am very glad that there is an open debate about this course now, and that we have the Wikipage to talk in a more informal manner, although it is not too much in use yet. I also notice that a lot of people have &#8220;fallen of the wagon&#8221;, and it will be interesting to see this week, with one of the more individual and creative assignments so far, how many hand in - and then how the new curriculum works out, with one week for posting your initial thoughts, and then one week for reflection and reading of others postings. I am a bit dismayed that some of the initial material that was more &#8220;generative&#8221;, like trying to persuade local colleagues to implement open practices, have been removed, but I am thinking about trying it anyway, hopefully with a colleague.</p><p>Stian<br /><em>(thanks a lot to <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/28481088@N00/"">Tanakawho @ flickr</a> for the abstract paintings)</em></p>","Jessie => It is good for you to read most of the books. When I have time later, I will try to read more. You seem not like the book that much, is it because you are in the education field but not business? I may be interested in reading it since I started with a business background, and later I want to have my own business. To broader my knowledge in another field is also very important to me. I may understand your points better when i read the book later.   I feel much better when I see the changes made on our syllabi. It is hard for someone who are not deeply involved in this field to try out a project like that, maybe just me. I was really worried before it changed that for me as an international student, how can I find a professional to agree with my open practice? Some of my classmates from other classes consider if they want to take this class later because of that project. I think I would like to definitely try the practice later when I have enough confidence with my knowledge in this field. Any one here can try it any time. David will be here and more and more classmates will join in, you can get comments any time. . "OpenEd: Week 10,,http://reganmian.net/blog/2007/11/01/opened-week-10/,"<p>I&#8217;m posting this weeks contribution early, since I am going away to Quebec for the weekend. I chanced upon a few posts that seem to be saying similar things.</p><p>Both <a href=""http://catiaharriman.blogspot.com/2007/10/week-9-elective-reading-synopses.html"">Catia</a> and <a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/fininformatica/VQIO/~3/176719511/"">Antonio</a> have read Coase&#8217;s Penguin or the Nature of the Firm. Catia discusses the different non-monetary incentives that can induce people to contribute to common projects, and how this can possibly be distorted by &#8220;unilateral appropriation of the content&#8221;, ie. some company making money out of adding value, without returning their additions to the community. In this case, a share-alike license would perhaps be very useful (although the problem it introduces with incompatibility with other open licenses has previously been discussed).</p><p>Antonio makes an interesting point, in that volunteers are great at dissecting, editing and recombining existing materials, which is a good argument for making as much material as possible available under open licenses - even if it is not yet in perfect pedagogical shape. Much has been argued about the granularity of different projects, and how that contributes to the ease of peer-collaboration. Perhaps it is true that a math textbook is better written by a few tight-knit collaborators, but their job would be immensely much easier, if there was a large selection of math problems, graphs, illustrations and photos, etc, that they could choose from, under an open and permissive license. (After they had produced a first draft, a community process could also be used to peer-review and improve the book).</p><p><a href=""http://iamarf.blogspot.com/2007/10/opened-week-9_29.html"">Andreas</a>, who read the same book as I did, Wikinomics, takes this one step further and states that many cases of peer-collaboration have been essentially unplanned, more process-driven than planned. Even IBM states that they did not know exactly where they were going with participating in the open source process, but wanted to be part of the movement. Andreas therefore argues that we cannot blueprint a peer-created commons process, but we can perhaps &#8220;prepare the ground&#8221;, as farmers do - in this case it might mean creating the right tools for the job (Wikimedia, Commentpress, Drupal, synchronous collaborative editing etc), providing enough raw material (resources under open and permissive licenses, texts, illustrations, videos, sound, etc), providing the license infrastructure needed for interaction between different projects (Creative Commons BY, GFDL), and then see what the community comes up with.</p><p>In this sense, Wikipedia is an incredible OER, not just as a finished product, but as a repository of information, illustrations, charts, etc. that are easy to find and all licensed under the GFDL.</p><p>Stian</p>",Subtitling II: Nothing is new under the stars,"languages,movies,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2007/11/11/subtitling-ii-nothing-is-new-under-the-stars/,"<p><img src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/269960.1020.A.jpg/200px-269960.1020.A.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""301"" width=""200"" />My friend Peder noted that this phenomenon was preceded by a film by Woody Allen, which took this to the extremes.

At that time entry to tertiary education was highly competitive but many citizens believed - and still believe - that the combination of competitive entry and free tuition would produce equitable participation in tertiary education from all socio-economic groups. Research now shows that this is simply not true (e.g. Levin, 1990). The socio-economic profile of students in countries that charge fees while providing scholarships and loans for poorer students is more broadly based than in those that do not charge fees. This is a very important finding, and one that governments are gradually finding the courage to act on.</font></p></blockquote><p>(His reference, which I should try to hunt down, is <font face=""verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"" size=""2"">Levin, B (1990) Tuition Fees and University Accessibility, Canadian Public Policy, Vol. XVI:1 , pp. 51-59 - <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/view/03170861/ap060069/06a00050/0?frame=noframe&amp;userID=8e96ccf5@utoronto.ca/01c0a8346600501cca8b7&amp;dpi=3&amp;config=jstor"">JSTOR link</a>).</font> Coming from a country with universal free higher education (Norway), I question this statement, although I&#8217;d certainly like to know more about it.</p><p>Three things that I came across during this reading:</p><ul><li>                               <font face=""verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"" size=""2"">Best Associates, a US merchant bank, is creating educational enterprises that are aimed squarely at combining greater learning effectiveness with dramatically lower costs. At the national level it is slashing the cost and improving the relevance of professional development for teachers through the American College of Education.

The mode of delivery is distance learning that blends the remote-classroom and asynchronous approaches. Lectures from senior professors are carried to remote classrooms by satellite or computer and these are underpinned by supporting professors who interact individually with relatively small groups of students online. Unlike conventional remote-classroom teaching this model is scalable because of the network of supporting professors; an essential feature for achieving a low price point. Another cost-saving principle is to use existing facilities, study centres and tele-centres.</font></li><li>A Chinese academic journal on open education research,<a href=""http://engine.cqvip.com/QK/80620X/"">开放教育研究</a> (Kaifang jiaoyu yanjiu).

In addition to some major events in my personal life, two important things have happened that are quite related to this course. The first is that I finally submitted my application for an MA in <a href=""http://oise.utoronto.ca/depts/tps"">theory and policy studies</a> at <a href=""http://oise.utoronto.ca"">Ontario Institute of Studies in Education</a>, part of <a href=""http://utoronto.ca"">University of Toronto</a>, with a specialization in <a href=""http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/depts/tps/Programs/Higher%20Ed/index-higher-ed.html"">higher education</a>. Here are some excerpts from my statement of intent, which gives an idea of what I&#8217;d like to study, partly inspired by this class.</p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/47/143186839_5c9fad13cd.jpg"" height=""300"" width=""450"" /></p><p><em>Universities are [...] currently undergoing rapid changes both reflected through the pressure of dramatically higher enrollments, marketization and pressures to remain current and therefore serve the knowledge economy. [...] Nowhere is this more true than in the emerging massification of higher education in developing countries, for example China and India. Technologies such as electronic distribution of academic scholarship, distance education and electronically mediated learning hold great promises in making education more effective, widening access to higher education, and redefining the traditional concept of buildings, institutions and processes that comprise a &#8220;university&#8221;. However, intellectual property regulations not only severely limit access to most institutions and individuals, but also limit how these materials can be used, reused and adapted into other cultural and linguistic contexts. I believe that the various open movements, beginning with open source, which inspired the campaign for open access to scholarly publications, and the open educational resources movement, have the potential to significantly broaden access, and qualitatively change the way students interact and learn, as well as the way in which knowledge is created and disseminated.</em></p><p><em>The Open Educational Resources movement gained publicity through MIT&#8217;s Open Courseware Project, [...]. It is a trend that is rapidly expanding and gaining significance, and which I have began to study and reflect on through my distance class on Open Educational Resources with professor David Wiley from Utah State University. I am interested in examining to what extent, and how, Open Educational Resources might improve access and quality of higher education in developing countries, facilitate the production and exchange of educational resources in and between developing countries, and enable higher education in local and regional languages. I have been very much inspired by the words of University of Oslo&#8217;s Birgit Brock-Utne, who stated that universal primary education must be pursued in concert with strengthening pre and in-service teacher education, research on schooling in indigenous languages, and the development of locally relevant curricula and textbooks. In all this, strong and effective universities in developing countries play a crucial role.<br /></em></p><p><em>Having spent a year teaching in a Chinese university, and speaking Chinese, I have developed a particular interest in this region. [...] China is one of the developing countries that have most aggressively adapted Open Educational Resources, both by translating MIT courses, and by several of the key universities producing and distributing their own lecture material through China Open Resources for Education (CORE). MIT promotional material states that this has &#8220;significantly changed the face of Chinese higher education&#8221;, yet research is underdeveloped in regards to how foreign educational resources are adapted and implemented in Chinese universities and classrooms, and what the educational and non-educational outcomes are.</em></p><p><em>Thus I am applying to do a Master of Arts [...]. My thesis research will be based on field work conducted at one or more of the key universities in China, which are currently actively implementing internationally produced Open Educational Resources, and are themselves producing and distributing Open Educational Resources based on their own teaching and research. Through in-depth interviews of administrators and professors, a study of policy documents and processes, an examination of curricula and Open Educational Materials themselves, and observation of lectures, I will explore the political and institutional processes that enable or promote the usage and production of OERs, how OERs from abroad are adapted to a different cultural context, if they are efficient in raising the quality of instruction and teaching outcomes, and their impact on educational and non-educational outcomes.</em></p><p><img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2166/1789363865_154a175a57_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""171"" />I have been struggling between choosing to focus more on the policy and macro-part, or more on the teaching/pedagogics/instructional technology part, both of which interest me a lot. OISE, which I really wanted to attend, did not seem to have a strong faculty in teaching and learning that focus on higher education, and they have a very strong faculty in internationalization of higher education, higher education in China etc, so I went this route. I was also wondering whether I would need lot&#8217;s of psychology and what not to go the pedagogics (andragogics?) part&#8230; However, I hope to be able to cover both somehow, or at least gradually find what interests me the most. I should have know the answer by mid-March. I also considered several other schools in the US, including even instructional technology at Utah State University <img src=&#039;http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&#039; alt=&#039;:)&#039; class=&#039;wp-smiley&#039; /> But I think for know, an MA at OISE would be perfect, since they have a very broad faculty and staff in all the areas that I am interested, and a great Center for International, Development, and Comparative Education center that I will be affiliated with.</p><p>Although I was obviously interested in these areas before taking the course, since I wouldn&#8217;t have taken it otherwise, I came across my proposed research topics through the readings in the course, and I also think it helped me think and formulate my thoughts more clearly. Thanks a lot to David Wiley, and all the participants!</p><p>Stian<br /><em>(thanks to <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/carbonnyc/"">CarbonNYC @ flickr</a> for the pictures)</em></p>",OpenEd: Why I was distracted II,,http://reganmian.net/blog/2007/11/22/opened-why-i-was-distracted-ii/,"<p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/79/241882694_52eb61059d_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""180"" width=""240"" />The other thing that has been going on is that I delivered a lecture on Open Learning and Global Education to the class I TA for on Tuesday. Although I taught English in a Chinese university for a year, and I have given several public presentations, this was my first proper two-hour academic lecture, with 75+ students and a Powerpoint. The professor was away, and I was very happy to be asked to give the lecture in his place. I wish I had thought of arranging for video or at least sound recording, both for my own sake, and for sharing it, but alas.</p><p>I wanted to share with the students many of the ideas that have come out of this class, but also putting it into a context, both of the history of education, universities developing as institutions, and the role they currently play, and the problems/challenges they are facing in both the developed world (Canada) and the developing world. We started by discussing the history of a university, and its &#8220;essence&#8221; - what is a university, and what is its purpose. How is it organized? I was trying to make them realize that the current way of organizing higher education is not by far the only possible way. I also showed them Michael Wesch&#8217;s video <a href=""http://mediatedcultures.net/ksudigg/?p=119"">A Vision of Students Today</a> (and I quite enjoyed the <a href=""http://mediatedcultures.net/ksudigg/?p=125#more-125"">&#8220;inverted list&#8221;</a> that <a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/fininformatica/VQIO/~3/182727823/"">Antonio Fini</a> linked to, might have to show that to my students).</p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/48/144282930_ea3aa758c3_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""180"" />After the break we discussed higher education in developing countries, the problems they face with colonial vestiges and massification of higher education, and how distance education and OERs could contribute to solve some of these problems. We ended with a short discussion on accreditation, both the idea promoted by the Economist (I cannot find this article) that Harvard should split into two, one that accreditates anyone that is good enough, and one that competes with any other school for preparing students for the tests. I even mentioned writings from the <a href=""http://www.swaraj.org/shikshantar/"">Indian NGO</a> that is <a href=""http://www.swaraj.org/shikshantar/healingdiplomadisease.pdf"">completely against accreditation</a>, and that I found through a link by <a href=""http://iamarf.blogspot.com/2007/08/open-ed-week-1.html"">Andreas Formiconi</a> during week 1).</p><p><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/open-learning-and-global-education"">My slides are online</a>.

Thanks for that. He mentions <a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HennisTalk/~3/187304176/openlearn-2007-from-boot-camp-to.html"">the idea</a> that university has gone from being seen as a boot camp, with deadlines, grades, and driving you through a pre-set program with strict discipline, to what could be termed a &#8220;holiday camp&#8221;, loosely <img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/152/376043104_25d7d73a3e_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""165"" width=""240"" />structured around self-chosen activities that are pleasant, but that you still learn from. I find this fascinating because one of the things we discussed quite a bit at the learning track in <a href=""http://icommons.org/isummit-07/"">Dubrovnik</a>, was the idea that a school or a university is much more than a collection of resources. It provides you a pathway through the resources, both micro (courses/sections) and macro (programs/degrees), it provides interaction with peers (students) and mentors (professors/TAs), and crucially it provides deadlines. Although not universally loved by everyone currently in the system, deadlines play a crucial role in keeping us working hard. This course is a good example of that - even though the topic interests me a great deal, and I have done a lot of reading about it earlier, without being prompted, there is no doubt that this structured course with weekly deadlines has made me put in much more effort.</p><p><strong>Tenure and dystopia</strong></p><p><a href=""http://gregfrancom.blogspot.com/2007/11/opened-week-13-tenuretrek-next.html""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/22/33935562_e67378c73e_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""240"" />Greg Francom</a> has already started on this week&#8217;s question, and tries to write an alternative story to David Wiley&#8217;s <a href=""http://opencontent.org/docs/future-history-of-oer.pdf"">Open CourseWars</a>, which is significantly more sinister, centering on ideas that there will be less money for science, a higher press graduate students and professors that do not yet have tenure, and the idea that in the end only the rich (who can afford to hire research assistants themselves) with no lives (that work 24/7 publishing papers) will survive. Whether this is a plausible trend, I do not know, but I am happy about the discussion, because I find discussion on the basic structures and mechanisms of academia to be very interesting. I am especially curious about tenure, I know several academics have stated that this is not very relevant anymore. I wonder if there are countries that do not use the tenure model, and how they compare. In fact, I wondered if my own country, Norway, has a tenure model, and I came across a very useful page from European University Institute <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-admin/"">listing academic career information</a> for different countries. <a href=""http://www.iue.it/MaxWeberProgramme/AcademicCareers/Norway.shtml"">Norway does seem to have tenure</a>, and it works in a bit of a peculiar way:</p><p><em>There are thus three ways to become Full Professor: 1) Apply for promotion based on individual competence (as described above). 2) By applying for a vacant professorship in open competition at any university and be appointed the best applicant. 3) By applying for a vacant professorship at any institution in Norway, being found unanimously competent (but not the best qualified for the specific position) and then claim to be promoted to full professor at own institution. The first is by far the most commonly used.</em></p><p><strong>Bike commute</strong></p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/56/149041905_c79ac0bf21_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""166"" width=""240"" />This is a bit of a distraction, but <a href=""http://darcynorman.net"">D&#8217;Arcy Norman</a> writes wonderfully detailed about <a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/DarcyNormanDotNet/%7E3/184812555/"">his bike commute</a> in Calgary. I love biking, and I have always been disappointed that Toronto doesn&#8217;t promote bike lanes and bike safety more - coming from Europe this is not an uncommon complaint I suppose. Downtown is still wonderful to bike in, but it would have been <em>so much better</em> with just a little bit of investment. As it is, I feel like a pawn in a video game, constantly expecting a car door on a parked car to suddenly open. And of course, I dream about seeing any city have the vision to pilot implementation of the <a href=""http://www.velo-city.ca/"">Velo-City</a>!</p><p><strong>The conundrum of context</strong></p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/170/406546065_e5d6c340f5_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""183"" width=""240"" />One word that has been bandied about a lot in this course, and especially in the discussion about learning objects, is <em>context</em>. Learning objects were portrayed as individual learning resources that should be as de-contextualized as possible, so that they can be used in different situations. I even wrote in my own answer, that people would have to adapt resources anyway, and the most important part was to make this easy and accessible. However, we have not discussed much how this contextualization would happen. Indeed, this goes to a general problem that I have had with thinking about education - I feel that I lack a general framework of pedagogics (or andragogics, heutagogics) - how do we learn? How does the combination of classroom lectures, use of the blackboard/powerpoint, assigning essays, midterms, finals, orals, projects&#8230; all lead us to learn? Not to talk about self-learners!</p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/177/388950702_8761b6421d_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""185"" width=""240"" />On this note, <a href=""http://gregfrancom.blogspot.com/2007/11/opened-learning-objects-are-not-dead.html"">Greg Francom</a> led me to <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcito.byuh.edu%2Fmerrill%2F&amp;ei=rUVGR6KVI5y0iAG3_ZXrAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBaRFvanUay_Rkpi8gJ_jfR2Gq5g&amp;sig2=We6OMdo9DR-RLHZzg2T5mA"">M.

Sometimes I feel like I need to take a sabbatical year only to process all the things I have added to my &#8220;read later&#8221; list this year.</p><p><a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/QnUt/~3/183422987/week-11.html"">Bobby McGhie Allen</a> points out that there is an idea that only &#8220;white males can contextualize&#8221;, and <a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/HennisTalk/%7E3/181642634/openlearn-2007-learner-generated.html"">Thieme </a>is asking us not to underestimate students - they constantly recontextualize learning materials, relating it to their own backgrounds and interests. And thinking about it, it struck me as very true. Most of the learning that I have done in my life has been individual and self-driven, whether it was reading books on phsychology or politics, or learning languages. In all cases, I use a wide variety of sources, academic research, blogs, discussions with friends, foreign language materials - and in all cases I take from it what I need, what is useful to me, taking into consideration who has produced it, <img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/418613466_5b3e242cb7_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""158"" width=""240"" />what their viewpoint is, how credible the source is, what it relates to, etc. Would I have benefited from someone &#8220;pre-contextualizing&#8221; all these sources for me? Not necessarily&#8230; This would probably be different in a fourth grade textbook on social science, and I agree that for a Physics 101 textbook, having a very coherent and logical presentation would be more important than for a course on women and development. (However, would anyone here really argue that a Japanese text book in Physics 101, translated word for word into English, would not be useful to me in learning physics? Oh no, they&#8217;re counting rice grains and not potatoes, I am so lost!?)</p><p><strong>The way forward</strong></p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/1/346073_53126d557b_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""153"" />In general, I am very happy to see students starting to reflect on what will happen after the course ends. The people who have made it through this program form a wonderful learning community, or community of practice, or whatever the current buzzword is, and it would be too bad if at the end of the course we delete our OPMLs, and continue on alone. It would be great if ideas and collaboration projects could grow from this list. Another idea is to try to start an advanced course next term, perhaps with the topics chosen by the participants, and trying to recruit scholars in different fields to suggest reading resources, or to host one or two week sessions on specific topics etc. It would be wonderful if we could find a model for collaborative learning that is sustainable, but still involved contact and tutoring by experienced scholars. But perhaps with such an experienced crowd, just learning from ourselves would be sufficient?</p><p>Stian<br /><em>(thanks to <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/josefstuefer/"">josef.stuefer @ flickr</a> for the bicycle wheel photo, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/asam/"">creativesam @ flickr</a> for the camels, the tree and the jumping birds, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/markybon/"">MarkyBon @ flickr</a></em><em> for the boy in the train, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/51456203@N00/"">ellhoisa @ flickr</a> for the peacock, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/schaaflicht/archives/date-posted/2004/09/05/"">schaaflicht @ flickr</a> for the hanging girl and <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/fortphoto/archives/date-posted/2007/01/31/"">Forth Photo @ flickr</a> for the birds on the field) </em></p>",Tools: Always find the longest Wikipedia article in a language you know,"languages,personal,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2007/11/22/tools-always-find-the-longest-wikipedia-article-in-a-language-you-know/,"<p>So I updated my tools, first adressing a silly bug in the redir script</p><p><em>(Update 23.11.2007: Fixed the code so that article names with spaces work again)</em></p><p>and also by changing the GET method in my bigger script (which I&#8217;ve had lying around for ever) to HEAD, so that it wouldn&#8217;t cause to much impact on Wikipedia, and I wouldn&#8217;t feel unethical releasing it.

Of course size is not a perfect measure of the quality of an article, but it&#8217;s a quick proxy for where there is most interesting content.</p><p>I was initially reluctant to release this, as I was worried about the impact of WP&#8217;s servers (it has to hit every single language version once to get the size), however I now changed it to use HEAD to make its requests, so each request is just a few byte. Through my experience with redir, I know that not many people will use this, and if they do, that&#8217;s just an incentive for Wikipedia to implement something similar natively.</p><p><em>This and more, on the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/140/"">tools page</a></em>.</p><p><em>(Update: I added the source code files on the tools page.)</em><em> </em></p><p>Stian<br /><em>(thanks to <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hugovk/"">hugovk @ flickr</a> for the picture)</em></p>","How to Get Six Pack Fast => Not that I&#039;m totally impressed, but this is a lot more than I expected for when I stumpled upon a link on Digg telling that the info   is awesome.

(Stian Haklev) </em></p><p>Lot&#8217;s of interesting questions that I have been thinking about for a long time, not the least throughout this course.</p><p><strong>Unpacking the university</strong></p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/122/309527777_01a0c4dcc0_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""160"" />One of the key ideas that I tried to bring across to my students during the lecture I recently gave was that the concept of a university as it exists at a given time in for example Canada is the product of historical, economical, political and structural factors (and probably some randomness), and that it is not &#8220;God-given&#8221;, that there are other ways of gaining higher knowledge than sitting in lecture theaters in old brick buildings doing four year degrees. Many things that determined the physical structure of a university are changing - it used to be that you needed a huge research library to be a world class university, and to be able to sustain that, you needed a certain enrollment size. With the gradual digitalization of resources, that is no longer so true, and might soon be wholly irrelevant. There is a lot of debris in the current model, and I think we need to go back to the roots and look at what we really want university to do for us, and how that can best be accomplished.</p><p><strong>The degree structure</strong></p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/34/93828022_c40c635786_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""160"" width=""240"" />So on one hand you have the physical properties, everyone knows what a university is &#8220;supposed to look like&#8221;. On the other hand you have the structure of the programs, courses, regulations etc. In a similar vein to what I stated above, there is nothing &#8220;written in stone&#8221; about four year undegraduate degrees, MAs and PhDs, lectures and tutorials, five courses at a time, midterms, finals, GPAs and so on (this is written with a North American perspective on purpose, because they are the ones who tend to think the least about other systems of learning). I could write a lot about the Swedish model, <img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/216/472799243_470f4d10eb_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""180"" />which is not radically different, but just the concept of only teaching one course at a time (half a year of anthropology, a year of psychology, etc - with enough breadth, depth and credits you get your BA - no majors or minors), which usually ends with a 5-8 hour exam, that often has two or three questions on it, is quite different.</p><p><strong>Inflation of degrees</strong></p><p>This is a problem that has been much discussed. The idea that the bar is pushed always higher - but not because we&#8217;re a &#8220;knowledge society&#8221; or what have you, but because of competition. Apparently they need an undergrad degree to work at Wal-Mart in China now, not because it is useful, but because competition is so high that you might as well hire the ones with degrees. In most Western countries, governments are aiming to put 50% of the young population through higher education (and even community colleges are starting to look increasingly like universities), but there is no way that these societies provide that amount of jobs requiring a university degree. Even our new principal at UTSC stated that a Masters is the new BA Honors. To me, this is a huge waste of societal resources, and the drive to get higher degrees by people who couldn&#8217;t care less about what they are learning, and will not be applying it, is ruining higher ed for everyone who actually give a damn (admittedly not many).</p><p><strong>Accreditation</strong></p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/153/425051782_1853c3bf93_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""199"" />Which brings me to a related issue, accreditation. As there are more and more ways of learning online, by distance, by alternative courses and self-chosen paths, should we institute new ways of accrediting people? I have written earlier about the idea of splitting Harvard into two independent parts, one teaching and one accrediting, and about the Indian NGO that waged a campaign against accreditation in the first place. Wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful if universities didn&#8217;t have the role to sort people, but rather to make all students learn and improve their own skills and understanding, and the way you proved to a company that you were worth hiring as by the actual work that you had done. As the open source idea extends to ever more domains, people might be participating in Wikipedia, writing open source textbooks, composing music, shooting footages for a collectively produced documentary&#8230; All this could be part of a portfolio of skills. Or would we have certifications, like we have for certain professions now? Instead of a bar exam, would an English major have to write an English lit certification test?</p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/98/237561007_8b09d74e54_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""234"" />Part of the problem is that there is a confusion between process and outcome. If we could define what exactly we wanted students to have gained at the end of a university period, then we could sit down and say &#8220;How do we best design a course of study that will provide these skills&#8221;, and we could presumably also measure it to a certain degree of accuracy. However, much of the thinking around higher education seems to start at the other end, with a pre-defined idea of a university (and idea that we tinker with, but never really rethink), and then asking ourselves &#8220;What can the students learn within this pre-ordained institution, and how will we measure it&#8221;. In fact, what we want is for students to be in a creative learning environment, one that forces them to think and reflect, and rub shoulders with scholars and peers, for four years. There are several studies showing that many students haven&#8217;t even significantly improved their creative thinking skills after four years, but we don&#8217;t mind, because we already know that this is the right thing for students. Colored of course by our romantization of own periods of college way back when, and the glorification of higher learning by mass culture (whether because of insights or party culture, it&#8217;s still &#8220;the place to be!&#8221;).</p><p>In this regard, I kind of like the Swedish model. In the beginning of the year they give you the curriculum, perhaps 3000 pages or so that you&#8217;ll need to read and understand well over the next four months. They give you the date for the final exam, and that&#8217;s it. There are lectures of course, to help you understand the readings, but no attendance is taken. You are assumed to be an adult, and if you believe going to Bali and spending four months there reading the material <img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/95/250686996_18b55710b5_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""160"" width=""240"" />and thinking about it will let you understand Descartes or the history of England better, then be my guest. You are taking the same (8 hours, two questions) exam in the end, and the university is confident that it is able to separate who has learnt something from who hasn&#8217;t. Indeed, I did just this, I did all the credits for my second year of Chinese (full time) while in China learning Chinese. I certainly learnt a lot more than had I been in class in Sweden - is there any reason I should not have gotten those marks, just because I was not present in class?</p><p>(I used the analogy of the TOEFL to my students - what if the University of Toronto said that the only way they could ensure that you had a good understanding of English was if you had spent one year at a certain specific school&#8230; Instead, the TOEFL allows you to learn English any way you want, through any number of institutions, self-learning, getting a foreign girlfriend, watching Hollywood movies, working as a maid in England - and in the end, it&#8217;s wholly irrelevant. You don&#8217;t even put down on paper where you learnt English, because they trust that the test accurately shows your command of English. (How accurate it is, is another matter). I obviously understand that testing knowledge in history is a lot more complicated than the TOEFL, but it would be a strange thing indeed if we just gave up on it&#8230;</p><p><strong>Improved teaching </strong></p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/8/8173741_d36a4e7d36_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""180"" width=""240"" />I have been mostly very disappointed by the pedagogics (or andragogics) of university teaching. Earlier in history, university was for the absolute elite, who wanted to fill a few positions, including becoming academics. It was a kind of apprenticeship to be a professor, and thus professors didn&#8217;t really have to be experts at pedagogics. Right now, we are putting millions of people through first year courses in economics and history, with professors who have never learnt anything about pedagogics. I would love more peer-review in teaching, teachers sitting in on each other&#8217;s classes, giving each other feedback. While this might be difficult to do in the real world (although I don&#8217;t know why), filming of lectures and putting them online can actually help this process - you are exposed to a number of teaching styles and can adopt one that suits you, etc.</p><p>However, in this network age, the concept of 1000 students sitting in front of a professor speaking in a mike and showing Powerpoint slides is quite outdated. I realized this summer at iCommons that there was no point in going to the big sessions. Even though the presenters were blockbuster names like Lawrence Lessig and Cory Doctorow, I realized that I didn&#8217;t get much more out of these sessions than I got from watching their lectures online. So I instead went for the smaller group sessions on education, where we all discussed intensely in breakout groups and came up with things together. This was a much more rational use of my few days in Dubrovnik. The same holds true for education. I remember reading about a professor of physics who recorded lectures especially for them to be put online, and then used the time he was allotted with the class to do experiments with them, having groups work and then circulate to help them. I would argue that this is a much more rational way of using the very expensive face time allotted with a professor.</p><p><strong>Distance ed / computer mediated learning</strong><br /><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/32/66165381_34f63aa27b_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""240"" />I am very interested in hybrid models that mix online and offline lectures. Imagine having a number of students at University of Toronto sign up for a class at Tokyo University. We would do the readings, watch the online lectures, and then meet in a colloquium at University of Toronto, perhaps even with a teaching assistant to help us, and discuss questions together. I mentioned above putting &#8220;canned content&#8221; online, so that you can spend your time interacting with students. I&#8217;ve found this in my own tutorials this year, when I stop standing in front of class and going through the assignments, and I give them free time to work on their projects and ask me questions, I circulate and discuss their different projects, help by asking them questions and forcing them to think deeper about what they are doing. That was a great learning experience for them (and for me, I think), and a much better use of my time.</p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/55/105627163_54799aabcf_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""180"" width=""240"" />But distance education also has the potential to widen access to learning for people who for many different reasons do not have access today. I consciously write learning, because I don&#8217;t want distance ed to become an excuse to force 100% of the population to go through higher education. There are lot&#8217;s of exciting models currently happening in developing (and developed countries), and this course (which I showed to my students) is a great example that a distance learning course doesn&#8217;t have to be just a little professor in a black window on your screen talking for two hours, but can be highly interactive.<br /><strong>Impact of open educational resources</strong></p><p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/115/296553221_ac57454405_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""201"" />I think OERs are going to play a huge role in all of this. To me, one of the most important OERs are actually academic articles and monographs. When they are freed up, we then need to provide the &#8220;glue&#8221; - lenses or playlists of good articles for a given topic at a given level, and perhaps background, explanation and analysis that helps students understand the articles. In addition we need the infrastructure for open learning - we need platforms where students can form learning networks, collaborate on course material, communicate with mentors (how this is financed is another chapter, whether through user fees or state sponsorship or exchange - I tutor you in something and someone else tutors me in something else) remains to be seen. All models will probably be tested.</p><p>I am not going to write anything more about OERs right now, because I believe <img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1135/1437417557_f2c5024c2b_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""231"" />we&#8217;ve covered it very well so far in the course, and I will not even answer my own question or write anything about K-12, but I will wait to see what others write, and come back to it next week.

Both then and now my time was spent trying to meet up with a few friends living here, and pounding the sidewalk in Manhattan to get an idea of the city. This time I was hoping to get a chance to venture outside Manhattan, especially visit the &#8220;real Chinatown&#8221; in Flushing (as opposed to the largely tourist-oriented one in Manhattan), but only two days and several people to meet didn&#8217;t allow me.</p><p>The first thing that struck me upon coming to New York this time, was the incredible security everywhere. A very frustrating thing is that there is apparently no place to store your luggage in downtown New York&#8230; I did some research before I came, and there was supposed to be a shop near Macy&#8217;s and Penn Station, but it had closed, and in Penn Station they would only accept it if I held a ticket (why? Will this foil a terrorist? Why not just raise the rates and make some money off me?) I understand that cities, especially ones like New York and London, are busy changing their streetscapes and procedures to fend off terrorism, some of it I can understand, much of it is ridiculous. But clearly, a world city such as NY should have a place to store luggage&#8230; Charge me for it, X-ray it (like they do at Liverpool stn. in London), but give me the option. For me, who arrived with a big backpack and a daypack, and wasn&#8217;t meeting my friend before 6PM that night, this was horrible. Luckily my Norwegian friend doing an internship in a swanky law firm downtown Manhattan came to my rescue (of course security wouldn&#8217;t even let me in to the building, even though he called down and let them know, so he had to come down and pick it up from me. Must have been a bit of an incongruous site to see him in his nice suit and tie with my dirty huge backpack that has been around the world).</p><p>Walking around Manhattan I also noticed the incredible amount of people doing lowly service jobs. I wonder what is the name of this category, but somehow to me guards and security personnel, people directing traffic, doormen and so on are in a different category from other service people - partly perhaps because there are so few of them in Norway. Indeed, many things about New York (read Manhattan) made me think of capitals in developing countries, like Jakarta. They are full of incredibly rich and swankily dressed people (waiting for my friend at Grand Central at 6PM I saw more well-dressed people walk past me in 10 minutes then I ever have), and people waiting on them. There are so obviously two classes of people, and as a friend of mine who used to live here pointed out, the people who &#8220;serve&#8221; can certainly not afford to live in Manhattan or anywhere near it.</p><p>There is an incredible police presence here. In Norway or Toronto there can be days between every time you see a police officer (except for campus police or transit police in Toronto - both of which don&#8217;t exist in Norway), but here they are on every street corner. There&#8217;s also a fair amount of traffic directing going on, which honestly I cannot figure out. It was the same thing in Indonesia, with almost every major intersection having a few people directing traffic during rush hour, except every hour was rush hour in Jakarta, and honestly cars mostly respected traffic signals even when there were no cops there, partly because it&#8217;s hard to dart across six-seven lanes of oncoming traffic. The only major difference was that the police would stop you from jaywalking (sneaking through the cars) and force you to go half a block down and across a huge long bridge), which did little good and just got everyone annoyed (it&#8217;s great to read that jaywalking - crossing the streets outside of a marked crossing - is not illegal in Toronto). Here, jaywalking is clearly not a big issue, since I&#8217;ve seen about three police officers doing it themselves (crossing a pedestrian crossing on a red light). And they didn&#8217;t exactly seem to be in hot pursuit of anyone.</p><p>I spent a lot of time in Russia and China before I came to North America for the first time, which has led to some funny insights. When I went to China and saw their modern buildings, I thought that they had taken &#8220;Western&#8221; designs and adapted them to their own ways, but when I came to Canada, some streetscapes reminded me incredibly of China (and I am not talking about Chinatown, but high street), because the building styles for skyscrapers was incredibly similar. To me, it seemed that Canada was copying China, but of course, chronologically it&#8217;s (for now) the other way around. Gigantic malls, and a lot of the big US fast food brands I&#8217;d only ever seen in Shanghai and Bangkok, not in Europe! Similarly, when I first went to Buffalo and Pittsburgh, they reminded me a lot of Russia, both because of wooden dilapidated houses in some residential streets, but also because of their huge brick 1930&#8217;s NY style skyscrapers. Of course, Stalin wanted to imitate New York and had the Seven Sisters built, one of which houses the Moscow University, and for example the Buffalo City Hall reminded me of them a lot.</p><p>It is funny having been fed with North American popular culture all your life, and when you come here there are some things that are so similar, and others that are very different. Americans films prepared me well for the idea of dense cities like Manhattan and San Francisco, but I did not realize that this was an absolute exception, and that most of America is strip-malls and sprawl - a small city I visited in the California valley was made up of almost only one-storey apartments that looked to me like the small vacation apartments belonging to hotels in Spain. When I wanted to buy some potato chips, we had to get in our car and drive to Wal-Mart quite a while away. I asked if there weren&#8217;t enough inhabitants in the area we lived to justify a kiosk, and my host answered that the zoning laws prevented it, people didn&#8217;t want a noisy business as their neighbor. It&#8217;s funny, in Norway we highlight &#8220;very close to shops, school, kindergarten, etc&#8221; in our housing ads. My house is across the street from a small shopping plaza, and that&#8217;s a huge selling point.</p><p>When I first came to Canada and saw yellow school buses (in Norway, school children ride on normal buses available to everyone, but most just walk or bike to school), I thought &#8220;that&#8217;s exactly like in the Simpson&#8217;s!&#8221; In New York I see fancy apartment lobbies and door guards, and think &#8220;Jerry Seinfeld&#8221; and &#8220;Sex and the City&#8221;. Much of the cityscape seems very industrial to me, the subway looks like a dismantled factory, and in yesterday&#8217;s grey hail, and with huge wallowing smoke clouds coming out from different openings in walls, sometimes the whole experience reminded me of something out of Blade Runner or Batman. Their money and their subway map reminds me of Monopoly&#8230;</p><p>One hypothesis, which I don&#8217;t have anywhere near enough evidence for yet, is that New York is more cosmopolitan than Toronto. With cosmopolitan, I mean the European ideal (perhaps more ideal than actual?) of &#8220;world citizens&#8221; who speak several languages, are interested in world affairs, and where you can go to the newspaper kiosk and buy magazines in 30 languages (certainly in my little town in Norway with 25.000 inhabitants and very few immigrants, we can easily obtain newspapers in at least 15-20 languages, and I often bought El Pais, Le Monde, Spiegel and The Guardian when I was in high school). Toronto is supposed to be the most international city in the world, and certainly the array of people inhabiting it is dizzying, there is almost nothing you cannot find in Toronto. However, it&#8217;s all so compartmentalized. If you want Chinese books, you have to go to Chinatown. If you want to watch a Hindi movie, there are three Bollywood theatres that cater to you (all in the suburbs of course). Why is it that when I go the biggest mainstream bookstore in Toronto, they don&#8217;t have a single book in Chinese (except for learning it), in fact they barely have books in French&#8230; And the suburban cinemas with 15 screens could certainly afford to offer a Chinese or Indian film once in a while, to reflect the people living around them.</p><p>Also many language groups in Toronto don&#8217;t like talking their mother tongues to people from other countries. This had me puzzled at first. I speak Chinese fluently, and if I meet a Chinese person, it&#8217;s natural for me to speak to them in Chinese. This isn&#8217;t because I want to practice or need a language exchange person to learn, but because that&#8217;s an efficient way of communicating (it&#8217;s also not to make a comment about their English level!)&#8230; However, in Canada many Chinese will consistently answer me back in English, and refuse to engage with me (much more common among younger people born in Canada than with recent immigrants from mainland China in the cafes, who can barely speak English)&#8230; I ate in three different cafes yesterday, and in all of them, it turned out that all the staff communicated with each other in Spanish, and most of the customers gave their orders in Spanish. I gave my first order in English, because I didn&#8217;t realize this, but subsequently I addressed the staff in Spanish, and they replied in Spanish as if it was the most natural thing in the world (which it was!). I don&#8217;t know why, but I have never felt comfortable speaking Spanish in some of the Latin American stores in Kensington Market for example, having a feeling that it would be like &#8220;showing off&#8221;, or a bit weird&#8230;</p><p>Also, on one subway ride (highly anecdotal!) I saw one woman reading a large Russian glossy weekly, a man intently studying what appeared to be the Koran with Arabic and Latin transliteration or explanation alongside it, and an older man reading a Chinese newspaper. In general, almost everyone were reading something, which was quite nice as well. You rarely hear other languages being spoken on public transit in Toronto, and while I have seen a few Chinese newspapers, I have barely ever seen one in another language (although they exist in abundance - there are hundreds of free weeklies in different languages published in Toronto!)&#8230; A friend of mine in Toronto has also been talking about how there is a huge pressure to communicate in English in Toronto, and that some people will avoid speaking different languages in public etc. It is interesting to think that this might be more prevalent in the US, with its &#8220;melting pot&#8221; strategy, than in Canada, with its &#8220;fruit bowl&#8221; approach (at least that&#8217;s what we learnt in English class in Norwegian secondary school). Of course - the US doesn&#8217;t have a federal language law, English became the national language kind of by default (and there are even some municipalities near the Mexican border that conduct their city council meetings in Spanish), whereas language is a huge and touchy topic in Canada.</p><p>I have some more thoughts on multilingualism, but I&#8217;ll save them for a separate post, this has already become long enough.

"My ideal research/annotation tool,"personal,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/01/09/my-ideal-researchannotation-tool/,"<p>I was reading a bit about different innovative text editors on Mac today. Of course, I have known about <a href=""http://macromates.com/"">TextMate</a> for a long time, and although it mainly changes the way programmers do work, some of the plugins are also useful for for example television script writers. Now I came across a bunch of different text editors/writing tools that aim to help people who write texts, whether literary or academic. This blogpost for example, I am writing in <a href=""http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom"">WriteRoom</a>, a simple text editor that blanks out the screen and displays nothing but your text in green on black in the middle of the screen - no blinking MSN, no GMail notifier or anything else flashy to distract you.</p><p>There&#8217;s also <a href=""http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html"">Scrivener</a>, which I just tried out, and which seems promising. It let&#8217;s you easily organize text into discrete chunks, and then reorganize them at will, and has a lot of other nifty features which could very well change the way you write, both academic and literary. It&#8217;s refreshing to see people trying to rethink how we use computers to author - rethinking the metaphores that we use. The idea of a blank paper in front of us (think MS Word style) which has been taken up by almost all text editors is intuitive - but also limiting in a way that is unnecessary on a computer.</p><p>However, when cooking I thought up what for me would be the perfect research / authoring tool. I constantly read a ton of information, both web pages, pdfs, and more seldom - .doc or .odt files. Sometimes what I am reading is directly related to what I am researching right now, but just as often it is something I just came across while looking for something else, that I still found interesting and wanted to skim through. Or I might just be browsing, reading articles linked from some of my favorite blogs.</p><p>My tool would let me view all these media types - odt/doc, pdf, html and maybe even rss (or just integrate with Google Reader, Flickr etc). It would let me very intuitively and easily mark up all the different files - I could easily either click somewhere in the pdf/html/doc/odt and insert a comment, or select a few lines and attach a comment to them, or just highlight some lines. Kind of like track changes in Word, but here&#8217;s the thing: I would be able to very easily extract a list of all my marked up text from a given PDF, with page numbers etc.</p><p>I could tag documents (regardless of type - it&#8217;s all information), and all the documents I ever entered into the system would be stored and fully full-text searchable. In addition, it would archive meta data: Which URL this PDF was downloaded from, what the URL was immediately before I downloaded it (ie. usually the &#8220;abstract page&#8221; etc), and it would even understand <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier"">DOI</a>s and common archive formats to be able to automatically extract full citation information and attach that to the files.</p><p>So when writing an essay, and remembering that I read something about the banking crisis in Russia a few months ago, and that there was a particularly salient paragraph, I&#8217;d be able to very easily find that text back, and drag the paragraph over into my text - which would be automatically footnoted with a citation in an appropriate format. Or I could ask to search all my comments for a given text, and have all the text pieces that had been marked up with that comment extracted and displayed together (properly cited).</p><p>Perhaps something similar to this is possible today, using different tools and plugins, but I don&#8217;t think there is a simple an elegant way of doing it.</p><p>And before I close, one thing that I have been wanting for a long time is a plugin for WordPress which let&#8217;s you quickly and easily search for CC licensed pictures, and then let&#8217;s you insert them easily into your blog, adding proper citation information below. I try to use illustrations to spruce up my longer blog entries, but first I have to find a picture, then insert a link to it, then flip back and copy the username, add a &#8220;Thanks to xxx for the username&#8221;, select xxx, add link, copy the link, etc&#8230; All this should be automated (of course, people using a CC-0 might help this - but I don&#8217;t mind giving attribution to people, just when it slows me down a lot).</p><p>Stian</p>",Providing multilingual services &#8211; if the Iranian can do it&#8230;,"languages,personal,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/01/10/providing-multilingual-services-if-the-iranian-can-do-it/,"<p>It happened two of the three times that I crossed the Niagara/Buffalo border last year, so it cannot be such a rare occurrence. The first time I met him in the line at Toronto Bus Terminal, and elderly Chinese guy. I chatted with him in Chinese, and he told me he&#8217;d lived in Canada for three years, but spoke almost no English. He was too old he said, if he learnt something one day, the next it was gone. He asked me if I could assist him later, if there would be any problem. I agreed.</p><p>At the border, I went in together with him, and interpreted for him during the border interview. They asked him a number of questions, he answered (through me), and he was asked to go to the next &#8220;station&#8221;. I myself had to get a new visa waiver, which would cost me 10$ US, and they did not accept Canadian dollars. They told me to run across to the other side were there was a tax free store, and change my money there. When I came back, they were waiting for me, and asked &#8220;Are you the guy who speaks Chinese?&#8221;. Apparently they had found some documents on him that contradicted the story that he had told through me. Now his explanations got much harder to interpret, and I was worried I&#8217;d get something wrong, but finally they let him through the border.</p><p>The second time, I passed through customs, and was waiting on the bus for at least half an hour. Then a customs officer came into the bus and asked &#8220;Does anyone speak Chinese here?&#8221;. I volunteered, and was taken inside to interpret for a young Chinese woman. The story was quite complicated, involving a miscarriage, family problems and health issues. I was in no way qualified to translate, but they had nobody else, and luckily they let her through in the end.</p><p>Canadian media reported before Christmas about a Polish traveller, traveling in an airplane in the first time for his life, who came to Vancouver to visit his mother. Speaking not a word of English, he somehow made it through immigration, but could not find the way out of the security zone. Apparently he spent over 8 hours in there, while his mother was waiting on the outside, just meters away. Finally he became agitated, and guards arrived and tasered him (nevermind that he could not possibly had had any weapons, being in the security zone, and that they should have been able to easily overman him). Because of a heart condition, he tragically died from being tasered (link<a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/11/14/bc-taservideo.html""> 1</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6nx0Cx3uMk"">2</a>).</p><p>My final exhibit is the <a href=""http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/"">Toronto TTC</a> (subway system). They have been displaying ads saying <a href=""http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/multilingual/multilang.htm"">&#8220;call xxx, talk to the TTC in 70 languages&#8221;</a>. I was always wondering how they would provide that many languages, and when I saw Malaysian on there, I thought I&#8217;d try it out (Bahasa Melayu is almost the same as Bahasa Indonesia, which I speak). I called the number, and was greeted by a menu &#8220;For information about surface routes, press 1. For information about subways, press 2. For information about delays, press 3.&#8221; (I am reconstructing purely after memory, but you get the general gist). [...] &#8220;For information in other languages, press 9&#8243;.</p><p>So someone who needed transit information, and did not speek English would probably already have hung up a long time ago. I wonder if they actually field tested this system on a single person who doesn&#8217;t speak any English.</p><p>As for the border crossing incidents, I&#8217;d like to propose a very simple solution that I experienced first hand in Iran. It&#8217;s quite curious, because at this time we had been travelling in the same way through four &#8220;&#8216;Stans&#8221;, and China, but this never happened there. However, in Iran a common occurence was that someone would see us stopping at a shop. They&#8217;d be very excited to talk to us, but spoke no English. Not easily deterred, they picked up their cell phone and called their English speaking cousin, and gave us the phone.</p><p>- &#8220;Hello?&#8221;<br />- &#8220;Hello! This is Ali&#8217;s cousin. How can I help you?&#8221;<br />- &#8220;Well&#8230; we don&#8217;t really need any help, we just got randomly handed this cell phone&#8221;.<br />- &#8220;OK, let me talk to my cousin again.&#8221;<br />(Lot&#8217;s of farsi being spoken)<br />- &#8220;So, my cousin would like to invite you for lunch.&#8221;<br />(We follow after the cousin, and receive delicious food and lot&#8217;s of laughs).</p><p>Such a simple method. I realize that the Niagara border cannot have a Chinese just waiting in case there is a Chinese crossing the border (they probably don&#8217;t even have anyone speaking French there), but why isn&#8217;t there some kind of central interpretation centre for the government, where they could call in, choose Chinese, and instantly get a Chinese interpreter on the phone? That Chinese interpreter would have been able to interpret better than I could have, and would always be available. Perhaps in big airports you could even install big phones, with one button for each language, so that you could easily get information in your own language if you got lost.</p><p>As for the TTC quandry, I have no simple solution. Is such a service even useful, even if they gave each language their own phone number? I wonder if there has been any research made on how to design services that are accessible to people who do not speak the local language. What are the services that would be useful to them? Is a Chinese map of the TTC a useful service for Chinese speakers, or is something else needed? An attempt to broaden access should be applauded, but this needs to be tested on the people who need it - monolingual English speakers will never be able to design efficient services for multilingual and multicultural access.</p><p>Stian</p>","Is TD &#8220;aapna&#8221; bank?

Currently I am learning Hindi, so of course I had to go out and investigate the tools available. Turns out that there&#8217;s not that much. <a href=""http://www.shabdkosh.com"">Shabdkosh</a> is a great online dictionary, being continually improved by users, however you have to actually go to the site to conduct a search. What I really wanted was a mouseover dictionary.</p><p>I found <a href=""http://www.gettranslateit.com/mac/"">TranslateIt!</a>, a program similar to <a href=""http://stardict.sourceforge.net/"">StarDict</a> that works on Mac, and integrates very well with all Cocoa applications, enabling you to both do normal searches, but also mouseover. Because it is compatible with the StarDict dictionary format, there is a huge array of dictionaries available for use. TranslateIt! itself seems to be made by a Russian company, and comes with very good dictionaries for Russian - and it even does inflections (since most Russian words tend to be heavily conjugated, this is key). This solved one long-standing need of mine - I speak some Russian, after having travelled there several times, and even attended the <a href=""http://www.rudn.ru/eng/dep.php"">Russian People&#8217;s Friendship University</a> (Университету дружбы народов) in Moscow for a month, and I often thought that if I had such an application and could actually read Wikipedia, Russian blogs etc, I&#8217;d get back into it.</p><p>So the hunt was on for a Hindi-English dictionary in StarDict format. Turns out all I could turn up were English-Hindi dictionaries, and in different formats. Finally, I took three English-Hindi dictionary files, all under an open license: one that I received from a friend doing research in machine translation, one generated from <a href=""http://www.dict.org"">dict.org</a>, and <a href=""http://www.iiit.net/ltrc/Dictionaries/Shabdanjali/dict-README.html"">Shabdanjali</a>. Shabdanjali had to be converted first from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCII"">ISCII</a> using a Python script. Then I wrote a hackish Ruby script (Ruby just excels at these quick one-off scripting jobs) that read the files that each had different (text-)file formats and reversed them into Hindi-English.</p><p>Reversal is absolutely non-trivial. At the simple side, you might have a file listing a bunch of simple word-word concurrances:</p><p><em>House-Haus<br />Boy-Junge</em></p><p>etc. In this case, it&#8217;s quite easy to turn around. But more commonly, a simple word will have either a definition (Zulu - a people in Southern Africa), or several different options, or a sentence fragment (Schreiben - to write), which is unhelpful because we are looking to make a dictionary that will actually match specific words in a text. One of the things I did was splitting up the listings in the target language (which became the source language), so that</p><p><em>boy - knabe; junge</em></p><p>would generate two entries<br /><em><br />knabe: boy<br />junge: boy</em></p><p>since a lot of hindi verbs are complex, with the most meaningful part coming first, I also split all multi-word phrases at the first word, but included the whole in the explanation, so that</p><p><em>starting - shuru karna</em> (शुरू करना)</p><p>would become</p><p>shuru - (shuru karna) starting</p><p>this hopefully maximizes the chance that you will hit right, even if what&#8217;s written is for example shuru kijie (please start - शुरू कीजिये). And when the match is all wrong, you&#8217;ll be able to see it from the context. Indeed the result is very far from perfect, but it&#8217;s sometimes helpful, and even when it&#8217;s way off, you can often understand the meaning from looking at the context (this is meant for someone who already knows some basic Hindi to aid in their reading of complex texts, not enable you to read Hindi from scratch). It&#8217;s certainly low quality, but I believe in putting things out there, instead of keeping it to myself. Maybe I will be able to improve it later on.</p><p>Having the word list unified and reversed, I still had to generate a StarDict file, which didn&#8217;t seem easy, so when I realized that TranslateIt! included a DictBuilder which could convert <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDXF"">xdfd</a> files, I decided to generate them with my Ruby script. The DictBuilder is a bit weird, first you have to &#8220;unpack&#8221; the xdxf file, which creates one file for each word in a directory (can easily be 40-50.000 files), and then it reads in all those files again to convert them to StarDict format. One would think it would be an easier way, but it does work.</p><p>If I were able to make some rules, I could improve the matching a lot as well. Hindi conjugations are mostly quite regular, and I wouldn&#8217;t need a lot of transformation rules to cover most of it (-iyan (-इयाँ) -&gt; -I (-ई)) for female plural to female singular, f.ex.). The other thing is that there are several sounds in Hindi that can and are spelt in different ways - for example whether using a bindi or a half n to nasalize (Hindi: हिन्दी/हिंदी) etc, which could also be taken care of in a rule-based system.</p><p>I would also love to incorporate an actual Hindi-English dictionary instead of what I have been able to hack up.

""Learning languages, working abroad in international development","languages,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/01/22/learning-languages-working-abroad-in-international-development/,"<p>This is a hand-out that a friend and I put together for a retreat this weekend together with students that will go on one year placements abroad. I wanted to emphasize the importance of learning languages, and give ideas about methods and resources.</p><p><strong>Handout on learning languages / bahasa-bahasa / 语言 / भाशाएं / языкoв<br /></strong><br />Learning a local language could be one of the most fulfilling parts of your placement, and will also help immensely in adapting to the local environment, making friends, gaining respect, understanding the culture, and doing research for your thesis. Even basic fluency and ability to read signs/ask for directions will also make you feel much safer and more confident in the streets. It will also probably make you a lot more useful to your organization. And it will enable you to talk to cab drivers and coconut sellers. Here are some points that might be useful.</p><p><strong>I&rsquo;m not good at learning languages</strong><br />Even if you do believe this, and you might be wrong, don&rsquo;t let it stop you! I have talked to several people among the fifth years who thought that they would not be able to learn anything, and didn&rsquo;t put a lot of effort in in the beginning. Towards the end they were really surprised at what they had accomplished, and regretted not starting earlier.<br /><strong><br />I will never become perfectly fluent/write the next great kiSwahili novel</strong><br />First of all, as stated above, never underestimate what you can do. But also, remember that even a little bit can take you a long way. In contexts with different alphabets, even being able to decode signs and bus routes could be incredibly useful, and most people really appreciate you making the effort (the only exception could be in areas where the majority speak another language, and every tourist learns just a phrase or two of the local language - in that case you might want to wait until you gain a little bit more fluency before you start showing off)</p><p><strong>When to start?</strong><br />As soon as possible! If you are reasonably sure that you know where you are going already, what are you waiting for? Learning a language is not something you do the night before you leave, sustained effort over a long time is much more efficient (but if you find out late, don&rsquo;t worry - I found out I was going to Indonesia two weeks before I left, and I was fine)<br /><strong><br />Before you leave - materials</strong><br />This depends a lot on which language you will be learning - when you find out ask me, or a fifth year that has been there, and we might be able to help you. In general, UofT library might have something, but Toronto Public Library is your saviour. They have a lot of language learning material in the reference library, and you can check on their website which branches carry materials for which languages (I was just at Agincourt yesterday checking out Hindi children&rsquo;s books - awesome). Branches also commonly have CDs, DVDs, etc.</p><p>You can try downloading movies or TV shows from that country through Bittorrent or Amule (ask me), or even find stuff on Youtube. Even if you don&rsquo;t understand, it can be neat to get a feel for how the language sounds, and what they are watching.</p><p>There are websites that lets you hookup with teachers either for a fee or language exchange students for free through Skype. (If anyone wants to learn Spanish talk to me - I know a very good one!)<br /><strong><br />What to bring</strong><br />Depending on the language again, you might want to find a speciality bookstore in Toronto, order something off Amazon, or photocopy pages from a library textbook. If you find a decent textbook and an OK dictionary, bring them - depending on where you go, you might not be able to find any textbooks (very hard to find in Indonesia for example), or any dictionaries appropriate for people who know English already (especially relevant if you are dealing with a new alphabet).</p><p><strong>When you are there</strong><br />Try to negotiate with your NGO to get language classes. The best way is to go away for at least a few weeks in the beginning to do something intensive - if you do a few hours a week you are often so tired, and they are so far apart, that you&rsquo;ll forget half of what you learn. If they are not able to provide it, you might negotiate with them to share the fee, or pay for it yourself, but get the time off - I promise you it will be so worth it!</p><p>Try using it as often as you can. The people in the office might be a bit annoyed the fifth time you are trying to spell your way through something, but the street vendors will be happy to talk to you, and often thrilled that someone is taking the time and effort. Living in a host family can be a real boon in this situation. Buy children&rsquo;s books, cartoons and local music. If they have a cinema, dubbed foreign movies are often easier to begin with, because they don&rsquo;t speak a dialect, and the sound is recorded in studio (better quality).</p><p><strong>Other ideas</strong><br />Try reading literature from the country you are going to that has been translated. Can be a great way of gaining some insight into a culture and history. Sometimes you can find translated novels in the country as well, but they tend to be very expensive.</p><p>Wikipedia exists in almost every small language you could encounter. Check out what they are writing about your home town in Canada. No article yet? Make it your goal for the year to add one!</p><p>Global Voices is an amazing project that writes summaries about what bloggers from different blogospheres around the world are writing about, with links to the original language posts.

Incidentally, I am going to a conference on international comparative education (<a href=""http://www.tc.edu/its/cies/"">CIES</a>) in New York in March, maybe I will try this there. </em></p><p><em>Either way, my first attempt is quite random - I was invited to tag along for a talk at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_University"">York University</a>, and since I&#8217;d never visited their campus, I decided to go (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keele_Campus_%28York_University%29"">Keele campus</a> is huge, cold, wind-blown, and most people didn&#8217;t know where the building we were looking for was). So today I am offering you a partial transcript (next time, I might try to do more distillation and insert my own analysis etc, but for now it&#8217;s pretty much the raw dump, a tad cleaned up), of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jian_Ghomeshi""><strong>Jian Ghomeshi</strong></a>&#8217;s talk on media literacy. Jian has a long career in music, television, and radio broadcasting, and is currently host of <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/q/"">Q</a> (which all through the presentation I thought was written Cue) on CBC, whose podcast I will not try to listen to.</em></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>You&#8217;re even wrong in your fallacy. Marshall McLuhan on camera.</p><p>Literacies - reading and writing, orality, numeracy, cultural literacy, arts, literacy from other cultures. Open a dialogue about all kinds of literacies.</p><p>Today&#8217;s speaker: Arts fan, friend of reading, last year he challenged audiences for Sounds like Canada to read Ulysses (James Joyce), books flew off the shelves in Oprah-like fashion. Canada reads - five celebrities vye for their book to be the book that all Canadians read this year. Popular show: Cue, CBC Radio 1, record ratings. About arts, entertainment and cultural things. Bridges the barriers between high art and popular art, makes us all end up reading Ulysses and knowing about Sundance. How does he use all the media that he is familiar with, and how does he stay abreast of new ways of communicating with audiences.</p><p><strong><img src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/Jian_128%28FINAL%29.jpg/180px-Jian_128%28FINAL%29.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""120"" width=""180"" />Jian Ghomeshi</strong><br />Persian-Canadian male Oprah<br />Promises us a lot of fun, we&#8217;ll forget that we&#8217;re learning things at the same time. Loves York University, at the forefront of the changing face of Canada. He felt like he fit in here, despite some of the aesthetic limitations of the campus. First generation Persian-Canadian. The importance of the learning experience and what it means that York university is the most multiracial university in Canda.</p><p>Slightly brown person in the media - we are so proud of you in the Ismaili community. (He is not Ismaili) There are not enough of us yet.</p><p>Gets confused for other &#8220;brown&#8221; people at CBC - there are five people and they cannot tell us apart.</p><p>Stabs at what media literacy might mean.<br />Interesting working at the CBC, if you are hosting a national show, there is no greater discerning and idosyncratic listener, than the CBC listener. The listeners have a proprietary sense of the CBC. We own it, want to talk about it, be part of it. Fortunately we are doing something right on Q.<br /><span id=""more-172""></span><br />People point out wrong word usage, pronunciation of words. Incredible learning place. Constant feedback. Constant focus group of a million people who will let you know when you make a mistake. I use words and language on purpose, so I almost anticipate their reactions. Concerns about regionalisms. You are such a Toronto guy. This is so urban. You left Fredricktown out, when you mentioned all the other places. A constant awareness in my mind, that it matters to them where they live, and who they are. The Blue Folder, things that we find regional things. CBC has a regional network, ferrets out intereting stories. In between the Woody Allen interviews. Makes a huge diference to the listeners. Fairness is also important, big issue. Much greater issue for the news anchors. I am an opinionated personality on CBC - not a reporter or anchor person.</p><p>Still an issue. Cultural affairs, very broadly speaking. National broadcaster in a media sense as The New York Times - the media source of record, there has to be fairness. If we talk about controversial art exhibit that did Piss Christ, men and boys photographs intimately involved, a lot of people don&#8217;t agree with him. Fairness.</p><p>Break the divide between intellectual and pretentious and accessible and perfunctory. Context of arts, culture and entertainment. What does it mean to be literate and to bridge that divide?<br />Intellectual and pretensito : Opera, The New Yorker, avant garde, Frank Gehry (from the audience), &#8230; controversial.</p><p>Accessible, perfunctory: South Park. Reality TV. Comic books. Rock and pop music. Pop culture.</p><p>Low arts:</p><p>Both sides profess distaste for the other side. Horrible opera/comic book person.</p><p>How do I become a great communicator where I can bridge that divide? The program is evidence of that - it&#8217;s multidisciplinary, punk-rock to author to visual arts story to Stanley, Spiderman. That hasn&#8217;t been done - most of media broadcasting whe it comes to arts and entertainment, and even in print, it is pigeon holed. Book show, rock show. This is our audience. Gamble. Important to me to be a communicator, accessible to septugenarians and 18-year old fans of sth.</p><p>Did Polysci/history degree. Interested in music and theater. Join a band. 10 years. Writing, Globe and Mail, Washington Post. Television. Then radio. Every step of the way lamenting that I was a jack of various trades, and a master of none. I could focus on the music, or academics. But I am ok at everything.</p><p>Saved by the modern economy! <img src=&#039;http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&#039; alt=&#039;:)&#039; class=&#039;wp-smiley&#039; /> </p><p>We&#8217;re all going to have six-seven jobs, except for the dentists.</p><p>Love of words, drives me. At CBC, even if I speak in &#8220;vernacular&#8221;, I get to use words that for most of my life my buddies would make fun of me, ooh &#8220;homogenous&#8221; big word&#8230; Desire to create social change - political guy, activist (persona non grata at York). Trouble maker. Discovering and supporting especially Candian artists.</p><p>Curiosity, telling stories.</p><p>The medium, and the means.</p><p>Medium - want to communicate an intellectual idea, or a story, or a political position, traditional ways to do that, there are new more interesting and perhaps more subversive ways, a lot of effective communication happening in places where we traditionally don&#8217;t expect it to happen.</p><p>Band touring in England, gets called, interview with Globe and Mail about Rush Limbaugh. Cover of the Globe and Mail - story - quoting him. Important turning point. Man, I could be an activist for 40 years, and running a labor union, and would not get quoted on the front page of the Globe and Mail. But because I am in a band, my opinion will be seen. Finding creative means to, mediums, to express what I want to express.</p><p>We used to learn in a top-down way, now people are becoming politicized through Daily Show, comedy, rock bands&#8230; CBC: communicating ideas to me in a non-proselytizing fashion is more effective.</p><p>In Band, we wrote satirical songs, if I wrote &#8220;Rush Limbaugh is an awful man&#8221;, nobody would listen. But if I wrote, &#8220;The greatest man in America&#8221;, getting so far and so absurd, sending the same message, but in a more entertaining way, I would be much more effective.</p><p>Means: we can reach a wide and diverse audience. The tone with which we talk to each other has changed. Tragic misconception that serious, precious and earnest = intelligent. Not true. Not anymore at least. Tone is important to me, I don&#8217;t believe that if I present things in too earnest a fashion, top-down, this is important to you, let me explain, I would not be hitting people Gen-Xers, younger people. We are not buying it (anymore). Too cynical. More atuned to matters of propaganda. Don&#8217;t believe everything that is told them in a serious voice. That&#8217;s why we like South Park and MIchael Moore movies.</p><p>Finding some kind of tone. I don&#8217;t want to be &#8220;unintelligent&#8221;. I want the content of what I am saying to be intelligent, a story or an idea or an interview, should still be smart, people who are curious should still be satiated and content. But don&#8217;t want to turn people away.</p><p>Intentionally unscripted. People were doing this a long time ago, and things became formalized. If I know I want to communicate an idea, and I&#8217;ve done my research - I will be more effective speaking to you in an unscripted fashion.</p><p>Don&#8217;t interview an author unless I&#8217;ve read the book, a musician without listening to the music etc. From being a musician myself. Doesn&#8217;t mean I speak better - means I am imperfect. Stuttering around sometimes. The show is live - they asked us if we should pre-tape it. If I am unscripted, I have to be thinking. You seem to be asking the questions that I would have asked. I take pride in that.</p><p>New media landscape, important to break the fourth wall, pull the curtain up on the wizard behind the curtain, acknowledging when we do something incorrectly. Admitting that we are wrong, or don&#8217;t understand. Took me a lot of courage, if I say in the middle of an interview with Woody Allen, I don&#8217;t really know what you are talking about. But every time I&#8217;ve done that, it has hit a chord, it has been effective.</p><p>We are attuned to the way things are made these days, we make our own home videos put them on Youtube, recording things all the time. People know how the shows are made, they know mistakes will be made. We will be more effective communicators if we communicate that.</p><p>Line between research and accessibility. The Hour. Dampen what I already know about it, to ask the questions I would have asked if I didn&#8217;t know about it. Especially when I am a musician interviewing other musicians. &#8220;What&#8217;s it like then to write music on the road&#8221;, I know, but somebody might want to know.</p><p>We&#8217;re not buying the experts. Outside of an academic context&#8230;?</p><p>Bridging the divide. Examples. I resent that when it comes to high arts, there is some notion, we can only speak to them, in formal deadly serious important language. Masterpiece theatre (in mock British accent). Takes art that in and of itself is not inaccessible, and it turns it in to something that is only for a group of people that use that language.</p><p>Four years ago the AGO, Paul Gaguin exhibit, painter, what was it like to walk in - the first thing you saw, was a wall. Symbolic and literal. On the wall, was a massive message in very caligraphy : Three paragraphs, dense, began: &#8220;Nineteen century philosopher Charles Baudelaire once said&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>For most of my life, a guy who is passionate about art and is an artist, cares deeply about culture, that would have been a message that this is not for me, you don&#8217;t even know who Charles Baudelaire is, what does it mean? You enter, then the paintings. Which are plainly put: naked women in Tahiti. Not something that any 19-year old couldn&#8217;t understand. Very interesting done, lot&#8217;s of stories. Presented in a way that suggests that it is only for a certain crowd. The art is accessible, could appeal to everybody. Shakespeare would be aghast at people paying inflated prices and watching his plays in tuxedos.</p><p>Ask the same questions of a rock band, or a chicklit writer, to an artist. Some of the greatest opera singers in the world, on the program, and I don&#8217;t develop a different tone and different questions. I ask them about what I&#8217;d ask any other people about. Opera singers have normal ideas, passions, hobbies.</p><p>These are just people.</p><p>The opposite is true too.</p><p>Long form interviews - don&#8217;t happen in broadcast media anymore&#8230;. 20 second clips, TV, radio.</p><p>When it comes to a rock band, we have to lower the level of discourse, ask them about drinking and sex, intentionally be perfunctory. Sensational. Why? If we start asking the same questions that we&#8217;d ask the opera singer, what emerges? Wow, every day - Michael Buble, he is a smart young guy. Slash, Guns and Roses, sometimes in print, but in broadcasting very few treated him as an intelligent guy, he rises to the challenge. Great interview, smart guy. Walking that line, accessible communications, new lexicon, bridging.</p><p>If we don&#8217;t see them as separate, we won&#8217;t communicate them as separate, and we won&#8217;t hear them as separate. Suddenly, ideas and divisions between high art and low, start to erode. Art, in and of itself, is accessible.</p><p>People are tired of superficial bite-sized interviews (some people), some peopl are no longer buying precious top-down important treatment. Find middle-ground.</p>",NLP Editor => Interesting blog post.

I have translated it below (slightly shortened):</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Indonesian government buys the copyright to textbooks<br /></strong><em>(From the newspaper Kompas, February 8, 2008)</em><span class=""fullpost""> </span></p><p>The Indonesian government has decided to buy the copyright of textbooks for primary, secondary and high school. The purpose is to bring down the price of textbooks to a quarter of the current price, and make books accessible to people. This was announced by president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in a press conference on the 6th of Feburary, 2008, after a meeting with the Department of Education, which discussed the evaluation of the program priorities of the department of education in 2005-2007, and their work program for 2008.</p><p>1200 persons from the education sector participated in the meeting, which was held in the Plaza Depdiknas (Department of Education) in Sudirman Street. There was also the vice president Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, ministers, governors, district heads and mayors from all over Indonesia, as well as headmasters, and deans of higher education institutions.</p><p>According to the president, one of the problems in the education sector is the price of text books. Because the books are expensive, many parents are not able to buy them, which inhibits the learning of their children. An important step is thus to reduce the price of text books. &#8220;One of the ways we&#8217;ll do this is through buying the copyright and giving the production rights to other publishers, so that the price of books can be reduced&#8221;, said the president. This step is also intended to avoid monopoly within the text book industry.</p><p>According to the president, the minister of education, Bambang Sudibyo, and provincial governments, have already been asked to follow up on this decision. The president added that the maximum prices of text books will later be set, so that there will be no more expensive text books. According to the president, the buying of copyright will happen gradually, according to the budget which is available. The target is more than 250 books. We hope that this can happen quickly. The Education Department will study the list of titles to be bought in detail.</p></blockquote><p>I actually heard this about half a year ago, when I participated in the World Book Day 2007 at the Department of Education plaza on Sudirman (same place as this was announced), however I have not seen a written source until now. I have the same thought in mind now, as I had then: This is a very interesting idea, but we should really try to campaign to have them adopt Creative Commons licenses for the material, and put it online as well. This might not make a huge difference to Indonesian school children (yet), but since they own the copyrights anyway, they could make a huge contribution to projects like Wikibooks, Wikipedia etc. And hopefully in the future they can also produce better quality and cheaper teaching materials by adapting material from open resources.</p><p>I even sent out a request to the isummit mailing list to see if they know of any groups promoting Creative Commons or open licensing in Indonesia, but so far I have not come across any.</p><p>Stian</p>","houshuang => I haven\&#039;t heard much about this, but I haven\&#039;t been spending too much time in the Indonesian blogosphere lately. These books were never meant to be licensed under CC licenses (I wish they had, of course). They would have had to use non-commercial licenses, since they want to limit the maximum retail price.  I think a project looking at the impact of this project on actual textbook availability and use in Indonesia would be great, but I don\&#039;t know of anyone pursuing that. Stian .

We<br />have now learned that a worldwide list exists on Wikipedia:<br /><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_libraries  "">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_libraries</a> </em></p><p><em><br />We think this is an excellent basis for developing a list: since it is open each country may add its<br />national library details and maintain them, thus avoiding setting up another infrastructure. We<br />encourage you therefore to check your country&rsquo;s national library (and other) details on this site and<br />update &ndash; or create - entries as required. Please let us know your comments on the entries and help<br />maintain an up-to-date list. As an example, the reference staff of the Swiss National Library ensure<br />that the Swiss entry is accurate and up-to-date as part of their general information service mission.<br />Thank you for your input! </em></p></blockquote><p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_libraries  "">list </a>does indeed exist. I think it is very forward-thinking of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Library_Associations_and_Institutions"">IFLA</a> to have their members contribute to Wikipedia instead of setting up their own list - with this effort we can ensure more high-quality content in one central location. However, it of course awakens the questions of editing articles about yourself. I suppose that nobody knows the central statistics of the National Library of Norway better than they themselves, and in one sense, it should be part of the job description of someone there to keep their Wikipedia page up to date with new numbers, facts etc. On the other hand - we don&#8217;t want anyone to &#8220;take ownership&#8221; of a page because of their authority&#8230; What happens if someone lists a national library that doesn&#8217;t fit IFLA&#8217;s definition of a national library (conjured up example)? Ideally people will then hash it out as equals - nevermind that one is a 14 year old, and the other is the world library association.

When attending high school in Italia, it was a special treat reading a novel in Italian where the protagonist would explain that his mother was from Trieste, and his father from Milano&#8230; I lived close to Trieste, and I knew about the connotations - what it &#8220;meant&#8221; to have a father from Trieste. Or a mother from Milano. I love watching movies from Oslo, the joy of recognizing the street cars and the subway, the shopping center I also used to shop at. It&#8217;s also interesting to read books about professors at the university of Oslo - gives me the possibility to peer into someone else&#8217;s life, who share the same physical space with me.</p><p>I firmly believe that humans want their lives to be reflect&#8230; we want to recognize ourselves, and our places. Fiction helps create a sense of place, space, belonging. What is &#8220;Toronto&#8221; except a random jumble of houses and streets? It&#8217;s fun to walk around in Lund, Sweden and think of all the places that are mentioned in the Wallander detective novels. When moving around a lot, trying to read local newspapers (not just national ones!) and local fiction is a great way of &#8220;getting under the skin&#8221; of a new place. I have long been saddened by the lack of good movies or TV shows coming out of Toronto - that are proudly Torontonian, showcasing their city instead of hiding it. Luckily one doesn&#8217;t need a huge budget to write a book, and so I am often much more easily able to find a book about whatever I want to read about, than I am to find a film.</p><p><img src=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4118RGPSG6L._AA240_.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""240"" width=""240"" />I have randomly come across a few books set in Toronto - <a href=""http://craphound.com/someone/"">Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town</a> by Cory Doctorow is set in Kensington Market, one of my favorite spots in Toronto, and where I used to live - I loved being able to look up the street address of the main character on Google Maps (I read it while in Mexico). However, without someone guiding you, it&#8217;s not easy to find Toronto-specific books. So when I came across a list of novels set in Toronto on <a href=""http://www.readingt.readingcities.com/index.php/toronto/comments/979/"">Toronto Reads</a>, I first wanted to blog about it, but then I decided to compress the entire post and all the comments into a simple list, and post it to Wikipedia. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fiction_set_in_Toronto"">List of fiction set in Toronto</a> was born. Hopefully others will add to it - especially movies would be great. Since I put it up a few days ago, someone has already added a collection of short stories, which is great. In the absence of page counters on Wikipedia, someone editing a page is pretty much the only way you know someone actually visited it <img src=&#039;http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&#039; alt=&#039;:)&#039; class=&#039;wp-smiley&#039; /> </p><p>I also ordered a few of the books at the UofT library, and just picked up three of them. I finished the first one, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cats-Crossing-Bill-Cameron/dp/0679311688"">Cat&#8217;s Crossing</a> by Bill Cameron on a few trips back and forth to UTSC on the subway, and it was a great read. It tells the stories of intertwining personal tales, with the unlikely protagonist being a cat (I am sure there is a Wikipedia page with &#8220;List of fiction told from a cat&#8217;s point of view&#8221; somewhere) that runs away from it&#8217;s overclass home, through the Toronto ravines and encounters a gaggle of interesting creatures, but there is also the rags to riches tale of a butcher, the cynical cop prowling the streets, a retired teacher sinking ever deeper into confusion, a wonderful apothecary, a TV personality&#8230; Sometimes I felt like the way of telling the story, and portraying the characters reminded me of a book written 50-80 years ago, like some of those early great American novels that I would borrow from my grandmother&#8217;s bookshelf and read as a young boy.</p><p>You often forget that he is writing about Toronto - but then it is brought right back to you. In fact, the whole city itself almost becomes a protagonist, it&#8217;s waterways described in scatological detail, it&#8217;s flows and pulses like veins pulsing through the fabric of the city, as if the city was a living breathing organism, sick and dirty the staggers forwards feeding off itself.</p><p>In the end, it was a great read, and I would love to check out other books by the same author, if he has written any. But in the meantime, I have two more Toronto novels waiting for me - and hopefully more to come. And I hope the list will keep expanding as I read of course. One thing I&#8217;d particularly like is to expand it to cover fiction about Toronto originally written in different languages - I remember reading a Chinese novel about Toronto, with a murder victim found dead in a hotel at Niagara, and the hero being a journalist in a Chinese newspaper office on Spadina. With such an incredibly diverse population, there is fiction written and shot about Toronto in all kinds of languages, and it would be great to make this more visible and accessible.</p><p>Stian<br /><em>(thanks to <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/coldcut/"">Cold Cut @ flickr</a> for the Toronto skyline photo)</em></p>","The Gardener, by Rabindranath Tagore, II","books,India,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/02/13/the-gardener-by-rabindranath-tagore-ii/,"<p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/56/171182413_2d4a7785d9_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""160"" width=""240"" />3.</p><p>In the morning I cast my net into the sea.</p><p>I dragged up from the dark abyss things of strange aspect and strange beauty - some shone like a smile, and some glistened like tears, and some were flushed like the cheeks of a bride.</p><p>When with the day&#8217;s burden I went home, my love was sitting in the garden, idly tearing the leaves of a flower.</p><p>I hesitated for a moment, and then placed at her feet all that I had dragged up, and stood silent.</p><p>She glanced at them and said, &#8216;What strange things are these?

Sometimes I write books down in my &#8220;books to read&#8221; list, or download pdfs meaning to read them later. Sometimes I spend hours on things that I absolutely do not have time for. But that&#8217;s probably how I learnt most of what I know. Even when I went to school in Italy, I could never study in the library, because I would always just grab a book from the shelves and start reading - unrelated to what I was actually trying to get done.</p><p>Tonight I am reading <a href=""http://worldcat.org/oclc/7875678&amp;referer=brief_results"">&#8220;Literature in Malay by the Chinese of Indonesia&#8221;</a>, a wonderful piece of research by <a href=""http://www.budpar.go.id/page.php?ic=611&amp;id=3229"">Claudine Salmon</a>, because it has some important passages about early lending libraries in Indonesia started by the Chinese. Here are two great quotes that are really useful in my research:</p><blockquote><p>p 93 <em>&#8220;It seems undeniable that at one time in the history of Java, members of communities of Chinese origin played a determining role by spreading the habit of reading, through taman bacaan or lenidng libraries, and then by being the first to take advantage of printing, recently spread by Europeans. Lastly, they suddenly confronted Malay speakers with a considerabl volume of historical, philosphical, technical and literary information, translated from both Chinese and European languages.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>p 112 <em>&#8220;Confronted by these rivals [Chinese publishers], Balai Pustaka became so anxious that in 1936 those in charge of the official publishing house sent a mission to inspect all the taman bacaan or &#8220;lending libraries&#8221; in Java. The mission found that the most frequently borrowed works all came from private publishing houses. Consequently, during the following year, Balai Pustaka launched a campaign to advertise the taman bacaan which bought its publications.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>Through the sources in her book, I came across some Chinese articles about early libraries in the Ming and Qing dynasties in China (one I was able to download through WangfangData, one I will pick up at the library tomorrow). I also find the topic of early literature in Indonesian very fascinating, it&#8217;s amazing to think about the Chinese peranakan living in Batavia and Weltevreden in 1870-1900 and writing these little snippets, some examples:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Dengan boeroe soeda di karang,<br />Biar di batja djoega sekarang;<br />Kabar itoe mendjadi girang,<br />Boeat semoea la orang-orang&#8221;</em><br />(the last four lines in a poem about the visit of the king of Siam (Thailand) in 1872, apologizing for the poor quality, and explaining that he wanted his poem finished so people could read it quickly - p. 20)</p><p><em> &#8220;Hamba bernama ABDUL KARIM,<br />Di negeri Ambon tempat moekim,<br />Anak piatoe lagipoen miskin,<br />Bahagian borgor tiada lain.</em></p><p><em>Satengah orang ada pangilan,<br />Majoor TJI ia seboetkan,<br />Nama jang benar kaloe soeratkan,<br />ABDUL KARIM TJIAT itoelah soenggohkan&#8221;</em><br />(self-description of a Chinese, head of the Chinese community in Ambon, written in 1890 - p. 25)</p></blockquote><p>They wrote lots of original literature describing both Chinese (Peranakan) and different local ethnic cultures, marriage and love, morals and crime. It would be incredible to be able to read some of these earliest descriptions of Indonesia - however it seems that most of these books now only exist in one or a few copies each, spread out over several libraries in Indonesia, and of course KITLV in Holland. In fact, when talking about an early attempt of literary adaption, when a French novel is translated into Indonesian, but set in China, and with Chinese names, Salmon mentions that it would be great to be able to examine the original titles and the translations side by side, but that this will be very difficult, since they exist in different libraries.</p><p>We are used to classical texts in English being made available online, whether earlier by the <a href=""http://gutenberg.org"">Gutenberg project</a>, or now by <a href=""http://books.google.com"">Google Books</a> and <a href=""http://www.opencontentalliance.org/"">The Open Content Alliance</a>. However, nothing like this exists for Indonesian. I really wish some Indonesian magnate (god knows there are enough of them) would fund a huge book scanning project to preserve this early Indonesian literary heritage, and also enable far more research and scholarship around them.</p><p>Stian</p>",Is Chinese the new French?,"asia,china,languages,politics,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/02/16/is-chinese-the-new-french/,"<p>Although it was Eurocentric, I like to think back at the time when all serious scholars in Europe were expected to know at least French (and by association perhaps Italian and Spanish), German, English and some Greek and Latin. When you read a book, and there are frequent citations in those languages, that are not translated. It is the same thing now, reading a book about the early history of literature in Indonesia, with none of the Indonesian citations translated.</p><p>With the Chinese gaining in geo-political strength every day, that language seems well-poised to become an important strategic asset as well. I already knew that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd"">Kevin Rudd</a>, the new prime minister of Australia, speaks Chinese - he was a diplomat there - and it makes sense that you want a prime minister of Australia that speaks Chinese (and seems much more open to the outside world than John Howard ever was).</p><p><img src=""http://www.cooperation-internationale.com/IMG/arton553.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""237"" width=""250"" />And through a <a href=""http://www.rue89.com/chinatown/jean-ping-un-dirigeant-africain-aux-accents-chinois"">French article</a> a friend of mine sent me, I just learnt that the head of the African Union is half-African, half-Chinese and speaks Mandarin. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Ping"">Jean Ping</a> from Gabon, son of a Chinese trader and a Gabonese mother, was chosen for the position on February 1st. And with the greatly increasing Chinese trade and investment with China, he is likely to be quite busy.</p><p>Stian</p>","Prokem, bahasa gaul, language inventiveness","asia,languages,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/02/17/prokem-bahasa-gaul-language-inventiveness/,"<p><a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/shaklev/SenenByNight/photo#5030894782659534626""><img src=""http://lh5.google.com/shaklev/RdFUJmbJnyI/AAAAAAAAAik/T_HH2jQeKpo/s288/P2120012.JPG"" align=""left"" /></a>One of the problems I had when learning Indonesian in Jakarta was that what people actually spoke seemed to be very distinct from what was in my textbooks (never mind that my textbooks were also about 20 years old, but most importantly they taught a very refined Indonesian. I remember on the title page was the admonition: <em>&#8220;Bicara bahasa Indonesia yang baik dan benar&#8221;</em>, speak correct Indonesian). I eventually realized that what the young people in the office were speaking was called &#8220;bahasa gaul&#8221;, a kind of youth slang that was both grammatically and morphologically quite different (although mostly in consistent ways) with standard Indonesian. Apparently it was related both to Betawi - the dialect of the &#8220;original&#8221; Jakartans (Jakarta being a melting pot of all ethnicities from the archipelago), Chinese - especially Hokkien words, and probably vocabulary both from prison/drug environments, and gay and transvestite culture.</p><p>This sociolect is of course in constant development - it might have started as something very local to a small group in Jakarta and other big cities, and then spread through the opening up of TV and radio, and later to be used in youth novels to make them more &#8220;realistic&#8221; (which meant that I could not at all understand the direct speech, and sometimes the entire contents, of youth novels until late in my language learning process). Now it is also being adopted by advertising posters and traditional media as &#8220;cool&#8221;. And interestingly almost all blogs and mailing lists are written in this style - which does not have a standardized spelling, making it hard sometimes to google for things.</p><p>There are several elements, and I won&#8217;t try to give a full account. There are lot&#8217;s of words that might come from Hokkien, Javanese or Sundanese or other local languages, English or Dutch (but often with a different, related meaning), or Indonesian that is transformed. For example <em>cewek</em> and <em>cowok </em>for girl (Bhs Indo: <em>perempuan</em> and <em>laki-laki</em>), <em>nyokap</em> and <em>bokap</em> for mum and dad (Bhs Indo: <em>ibu</em> and <em>bapak</em> - which are also used as honorifics). Then there is the different &#8220;conjugations&#8221;, where for example the suffix <em>-kan</em>, used to make a verb transitive, becomes <em>-in</em>, and the initial <em>meng/men/meny</em> (depending on the following letter), also a prefix for transitive verbs, become <em>ng-, ny-. </em>So <em>mengapakan</em> (the transitive form of &#8220;what&#8221; = &#8220;what are you doing&#8221;) becomes <em>ngapain</em> (a common question - what&#8217;s up?).</p><p>I also noticed that Indonesians seemed to have a very playful relationship with their language, and love to create new words - very often based by syllable abbreviations (that remind me of Russian <em>komsomol</em> style abbreviations). I don&#8217;t know how far back in time this goes, but it is not at all confined to slang - the department of education has <em>Depdiknas</em> written with large letters on its building (<em><strong>Dep</strong>artement  pendi<strong>dik</strong>an<strong> nas</strong>ional</em>) - a good example of how it seems quite random which syllables are chosen. (My boss in Jakarta complained about <em>gakin </em>- <em>keluar<strong>ga</strong> mis<strong>kin</strong></em> - poor families). But this is also used a lot in youth cultures (and not just adolescent - people I worked with at the office delighted in making up new ones, and using them).</p><p>All this to say that I just came across a very interesting article about <em>bahasa prokem</em> (apparently <em>prokem</em> is derived from <em>preman</em> - the small crooks that control territories in Jakarta and demand protection money, etc - a word derived from the Dutch <em>vrijman</em>), a kind of precursor to the current <em>bahasa gaul</em> (<em>gaul</em> means something like social, mixing - has connotations with naughty, and the term <em>pergaulan bebas</em> which means free sex) from around the 1980s. He gives lot&#8217;s of examples, and although most of it is much more radical than what I have been hearing (although it might still live on in parts of the population that I have not frequented), it&#8217;s fun to see the origins of some words that are now largely accepted parts of casual speech, like <em>bokap</em> and <em>nyokap</em>.</p><p><a href=""http://e-publishing.library.cornell.edu/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=seap.indo/1107019146"">&#8220;Those who speak Prokem&#8221;,</a> by Henri Chambert-Loir.</p><p>Stian</p><p>PS: This blog post is also an example of the power of open access publishing - I would not have bothered blogging about this article, if it had not been available for free download, since presumably most readers either a) don&#8217;t have access to institutional article databases, and b) even if they had, wouldn&#8217;t bother searching up this article, but want a direct link.</p><p>PPS: I took the picture at night in <em>Pasar Senen</em>, which certainly has enough <em>preman</em> and <em>anak2 nongkrong</em>.</p>","How to Get Six Pack Fast => Not that I&#039;m totally impressed, but this is a lot more than I expected   when I found a link on Furl telling that the info here is awesome.

Later, I learnt about CVS and SVN and thought it was a neat way of enabling lot&#8217;s of people to collaborate online. I used it so I could access cutting edge open source software, but never thought about using it for my own little programs. Then, in Indonesia and working on Ruby on Rails, I started reading up on it, and found out that it would be a very useful thing. I got into SVN, and found that it really changed the way I worked with code. Later I realized that even for an individual programmer, distributed version control has a lot of advantages (like when working on different computers), and I tried out a bunch - git, darcs, bazaar, mercurial&#8230;</p><p>I never understood why Bazaar was so popular among the Ubuntu crowd, because to me it seemed very slow and under-featured. Especially the concept (which might have changed by now), that to branch I had to copy the whole thing to a separate directory seemed incredibly inefficient. What if I want to put a huge source tree with thousands of files, make a branch and quickly change one of them to see what happens? With git, that&#8217;s instantaneous. I also really appreciated the architecture and the design philosophy. I first put two projects on <a href=""http://repo.or.cz"">repo.or.cz</a>, which was decent. But today I just came across <a href=""http://gitorious.org"">Gitorious</a>, which is really far more advanced and user friendly.

There are many aspects to this field, however many face the issue because they need to get &#8220;ethics approval&#8221; for any research on human subjects. They have to promise things like anonymity, informed consent and safety of source data. However, I believe that when working in developing countries especially, there are other issues that are also important.</p><p>I have come up with a few points that I would like to commit myself to, and which I think are important and decent in terms of doing research in developing countries.</p><ul><li>All research output should be published through open-access channels, whether open-access journals, or journals that allow self-archiving.</li><li>All research output should be translated to a language commonly used in the language where research was conducted.</li></ul><p>The purpose of these two points is to give access to your research for researchers in the country where you conducted the research. However, if the people you conducted research on are not comfortable reading academic papers, translating it might not be enough to give the research subjects access to your research.</p><ul><li>Convey the main findings of your research in a way that research subjects themselves can understand, whether through a written account in an appropriate language and vocabulary, through an oral presentation or otherwise.</li></ul><p>I personally believe that in being accountable to the people we research, we are also more responsible in what we write. This is not meant as censorship, but if we write about rich and powerful, they will have access to what we have written afterwards anyway, so why be any <em>less</em> careful when we write about marginalized groups, then when we write about powerful groups?</p><p>As I mentioned, many researchers discuss research ethics, but I seldom see people commit to the points listed above. I was impressed however, by the answers given by <a href=""http://www.gse.upenn.edu/faculty/lukose.html"">Dr. Ritty A. Lukose</a> during her job talk at <a href=""http://www.oise.utoronto.ca"">OISE</a>, when I asked her how she made sure that her research and scholarship also benefitted people in Kerala and India, where she does her research. She told me that she frequently publishes in Indian journals, teaches graduate students in Bangalore, runs workshops in India, etc. Thus in addition to the above-mentioned points, one should strive to</p><ul><li>Collaborate with researchers from developing countries as equal partners, taking into considerations their theories and analyses, and not just use them as research assistants.</li><li>Contribute to training graduate students and young researchers in developing countries.</li><li>Help researchers in developing countries get their work published.</li><li>Contribute to scholarship from developing countries being made accessible online so that they can participate in the international scholarly discourse.</li></ul><p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/69275268@N00/354091619/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/133/354091619_1dbf98772c_m.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0"" /></a><br />The title of this blog post comes from the flippant idea I had this morning in conversation with my flat mates that perhaps some kind of a &#8220;Fair Research&#8221; designation should be developed, with a logo that could be applied to research materials, certifying that they had followed a certain number of practices. I realize that this would probably be very inflexible, as researchers are continually re-evaluating what practices are appropriate in any given situation. Yet, I would like to see a much stronger movement to force people to consider these ideas.</p><p>Stian</p><p><small><a href=""http://www.photodropper.com/creative-commons/"" title=""creative commons"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/plugins/photo_dropper/images/cc.png"" alt=""Creative Commons License"" align=""absmiddle"" border=""0"" height=""16"" width=""16"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.photodropper.com/photos/"" target=""_blank"">photo</a> credits: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/55305480@N00/468843631/"" title=""volvidejapon"" target=""_blank"">volvidejapon</a></small><small>, </small><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/55305480@N00/468843631/"" title=""volvidejapon"" target=""_blank""><small></small></a><small><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/69275268@N00/354091619/"" title=""rosemanios"" target=""_blank"">rosemanios</a></small></p>","New Chinese blog, and translating my thesis to Chinese | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] to do &ndash; when so many people in China have gone out of their way to help me in my research (see my thoughts about this), but also because I want my thesis to be a part of the scholarly discourse in [...].

"Individual article statistics for Wikipedia: Endless amusement,"languages,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/03/09/individual-article-statistics-for-wikipedia-endless-amusement/,"<p>I love Wikipedia (despite the occasional problems, unreasonableness, problems of governance and growing pains). One of the reasons I&#8217;ve always enjoyed contributing is that you are guaranteed an audience. Writing on this blog, for example, I never really know if anyone is reading. I can see my website statistics, but they are notoriously fickle - it proclaims to be able to sort out search engines, etc, but I never trust it entirely. That is why it is so gratifying when people leave comments, or when you suddenly find yourself linked to by other people, whom you didn&#8217;t even know were reading your blog (which happened to me twice today).</p><p>However, on Wikipedia you can rest assured that almost no matter how obscure the topic is, some people will read your article (the ominous &#8220;Citation needed tag&#8221; that inevitably pop up on any new article is proof of that). Part of the reason is that people patrol the recent changes list, and jump in to add categories, etc. But a big part of it is simply the massive amount of Wikipedia users, and their diverse interests. I&#8217;ve always wanted to have individual article statistics for different articles I wrote, and until now have had to content myself with the various top-100 articles lists that were produced.</p><p>However, today I came across a site that offers updated access statistics for all Wikipedia articles, across domains. It is great fun to look at some of the articles that I have created, or contributed significantly to. <a href=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Podsol"">Podsol</a>, which I often use as an illustration of how Wikipedia articles develop, gets between 30 and 60 hits per day, the very minimal article on the Indonesian city <a href=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Atambua"">Atambua</a> about ten a day. And my newest creation, the <a href=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fiction_set_in_Toronto"">List of fiction set in Toronto</a> has an average of at least 15 a day.</p><p><img src=""http://lh6.google.com/shaklev/R9SgCyFSuXI/AAAAAAAABWg/OId864VKteQ/968f06a5_Picture202"" align=""left"" height=""209"" width=""347"" />Looking at larger articles, the article on <a href=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo"">Kosovo</a> (which I had no hand in creating) clearly shows how Wikipedia has become the place to go for people wanting to understand the news - there is a huge spike (see left) on the day that independence was declared, with an incredible <a href=""http://stats.grok.se/en/200802/Kosovo"">245,000 page views</a> on that day alone. This exact trend was replicated for the <a href=""http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A7%91%E7%B4%A2%E6%B2%83"">Chinese Wikipedia</a>&#8217;s article (a top of around <a href=""http://stats.grok.se/zh/200802/%E7%A7%91%E7%B4%A2%E6%B2%83"">6,000 hits</a> on the 18th), the <a href=""http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%81%D9%88"">Arabic Wikipedia</a> (a top of <a href=""http://stats.grok.se/ar/200802/%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%81%D9%88"">1,800 hits</a> on the 18th), and even the <a href=""http://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%8B"">Hindi Wikipedia</a>, which went from <a href=""http://stats.grok.se/hi/200802/%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%8B"">no hits at all to 88</a> on the 18th. The Hindi Wikipedia still only has one single sentence however, which must have been quite depressing to those visiting the page eager for information. This should also serve as encouragement to those writing for the Hindi Wikipedia - there is demand for information in Hindi! Interestingly, in the <a href=""http://bn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%AD%E0%A7%8B"">Bengali Wikipedia</a>, <a href=""http://stats.grok.se/bn/200802/%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%AD%E0%A7%8B"">the same huge jump came</a>, but only around the 24th/25th, which might reflect when the Bengali government made statements about recognition.</p><p>I could think of a lot of things to do with these statistics, especially because they are multilingual, and because of the nice way the interwiki links connect articles together - theoretically it would be quite possible to write a script that showed the graphs for the articles on any topic on for many different languages simultaneously, so that one could see how news spread around the world, for example.</p><p>Stian<br />(PS: Also have a look at the great page <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_reaction_to_the_2008_Kosovo_declaration_of_independence"">summarizing the international reactions to Kosovo&#8217;s declaration of independence</a>, with almost 200 sources summarized in a very clear format - this should be a great page to show anyone who claims that Wikipedia is not &#8220;trustworthy&#8221;, and an example of information that you could probably not find in such a comprehensive form anywhere else - most of the article has even been translated into 12 other languages alread, including Arabic and Hungarian)</p>",Bennett Mccarley => I like the valuable information you provide in your articles.

I played with it on and off during the first year in Toronto, doing tutorials and thinking about neat apps, but never really coming up with any apps that I wanted to create. Then, in the summer I ended up spending about a month writing a series of scripts to move about 800 HTML pages and pictures etc from EZPublish to DokuWiki for <a href=""http://www.healthwrights.org/"">HealthWrights</a> while working for them in Mexico (it obviously took so long because I was learning as I went along, and also because the EZPublish output is really messy).</p><p>Not much Ruby during the year after that, although sometimes I&#8217;d get a kick and sit up all night trying to figure stuff out. And then I&#8217;d forget about it. Then in Indonesia working for <a href=""http://careindonesia.or.id"">CARE</a>, we ended up choosing to implement a intranet file library in Ruby on Rails, which I spent several months working on to extend its capabilities quite significantly. This meant that I learnt Ruby on Rails, and also version control, first svn and then git, and generally got much deeper into the Ruby way. The sad thing was that the original programmer had left development and so there was no one to discuss it with.</p><p>Another thing that I spent a lot of time on during my stay in Indonesia was coming up with a system for viewing Wikipedia offline (the entire database of articles of any given language). I have spent incredible amounts of time on this (because I am a lousy programmer) and gone down so many paths that ended up being useless&#8230; I might write more about my &#8220;journey&#8221; later. Either way, towards April I actually had <a href=""http://gitorious.org/projects/zip-doc"">a Ruby application that more or less worked quite well</a> and according to specifications. However, I ran into two major limitations of Ruby, and where I sadly believe that Ruby lags far behind Python.</p><p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/22339026@N00/145786038/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/55/145786038_84d21cc680_m.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0"" /></a>I wanted to distribute the program in an easy to install file, or even better, in a CDROM with the database, which could be run directly from the CDROM without even installing, of course Mac/Linux/Windows friendly. However, this requires two thing: A (very minimal) graphical interface, and a way of installing/bundling all the files necessary. There are bindings for lot&#8217;s of graphical interfaces for Ruby, but it&#8217;s still very immature, there are few frameworks that work well across all three platforms, and the lack of actual applications written using these frameworks means that it is very hard to find example code. This isn&#8217;t a show stopper for this particular app which only needs an incredibly rudimentary GUI (pretty much a box saying &#8220;Web server is running, press here to stop it&#8221;), but it&#8217;s too bad. I have high hopes for the Qt integration, eventually&#8230;</p><p>More significantly, there is still not a single good way of distributing Ruby apps in a binary fashion. Ruby itself hasn&#8217;t even considered the problem, and the only half-solutions that exist are hacks which get no support from the Ruby core. Most Rubyists either use it to scratch their own itches (this is usually what I use it for nowadays also, quick five liners to do something to a file once), to write libraries that they distribute to other programmers, or to write servers or Ruby on Rails apps. My script works great on any platform, but first you must install all of Ruby, plus Rubygems, then install Trollops (I could distribute this myself, since it&#8217;s a Ruby script), and then download the <a href=""raa.ruby-lang.org/project/bz2/"">BZip2 C extension</a> (which isn&#8217;t even a Gem), and compile it for whatever architecture you are on.</p><p>There are tools such as <a href=""http://www.erikveen.dds.nl/rubyscript2exe/"">Rubyscript2exe</a> (for all three platforms), <a href=""http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus"">Platypus</a> (for Mac - not restricted to Ruby) and <a href=""http://exerb.sourceforge.jp/index.en.html"">Exerb</a> for Windows, however I&#8217;ve had mix success with two of them (not tried Exerb). Because my script relies on a bunch of different files, as well as the includes, and especially the C library. The C library is the biggest problem - but I refuse to go back to ZLib, which is at least 30% as efficient. I think it&#8217;s very sad that it is so hard to make desktop applications with Ruby and distribute them - this is a position that Python has excelled in, with for example <a href=""http://www.getmiro.com/"">Miro</a> as a flagship application. There are incredibly smart minds in the Ruby movement, and I am sure that if <a href=""http://whytheluckystiff.net/"">_why the lucky stiff</a> put his mind to it, he could couple together a platform in an hour - but nobody seems to have taken it seriously so far.</p><p>Recently a friend of mine showed interest, and I started thinking about the application again. I thought that perhaps one of the new implementations, <a href=""http://rubini.us/"">Rubinius</a> or <a href=""http://jruby.codehaus.org/"">JRuby</a> would be able to help. Rubinius didn&#8217;t want to run it at all, but JRuby intitially seemed promising. They cannot use the C extension, however there is a <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/sandbox/compress/apidocs/org/apache/commons/compress/bzip2/package-summary.html"">Java implemention of BZip2 from Apache</a>, and using this would give the added benefit of being completely in Java. I then imagined that it would be easy to package it up and distribute as a Java app - perhaps using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)"">Swing</a> or something similar for the limited GUI.</p><p>However, I ran into problems again. First of all, I am completely lost at Java, and trying to figure out how in the world to interact with the BZip2 Java library was a complete mess, with all kinds of InputStreams and OutputStreams and I don&#8217;t know what. To compare, after having required the bzip2 library, this is literally the only line needed to uncompress a bzip2 compressed chunk stored in the variable txt: BZ2::Reader.new(txt).read. Whenever I duck into C or Java because of something I have to do (and usually fail to do) I run away screaming at the incredible complexity of doing the simplest things.</p><p>In addition to this (I really hope they implement a Ruby bridge to BZip2, just as they have to GZip, this would be incredibly useful!), the project is still not complete, and especially it seems like their File::Find module does not support unicode, which obviously won&#8217;t work for Wikipedia pages. So I am back at square one again. After another seven hours spent trying to fix it.</p><p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/76261353@N00/296445681/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/117/296445681_fc79cc2590_m.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0"" /></a>Of course, if anyone else in the whole world thought the idea of a complete version of the entire database of Wikipedia accessible on a CDROM/DVD was kind of useful, someone who actually knows programming could probably help me with this in an hour. I would have no problem with having the reader implemented in Python if that made it easier to distribute it - it&#8217;s only perhaps 100 LOC, and the method of accessing the binary files is very clearly explained in my README files. But somehow either people are not at all excited about an offline Wikipedia, which I find very strange, or they design huge projects, reimplement the browser and make fancy webpages, but never actually produce anything.</p><p>Oh well. That was my little Ruby craziness. Hopefully I won&#8217;t have another for a few months.

There have also been discussions about the terms of use (many books that are clearly in the public domain show up only in snippet view), the terms of use for the libraries participating, and what data they get to keep. I think Google Books is a great project, and I have used it several times in my research, both to find books that I check out offline, and sometimes I am even lucky enough to get access to a long enough snippet in a copyrighted book that it&#8217;s sufficient.</p><p>At around the same time as Google started their great project, the <a href=""http://www.opencontentalliance.org/index.html"">Open Content Alliance</a> was formed with Yahoo! and the wonderful Internet Archive as main players, and Microsoft playing a side role. (Apparently they have now <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Content_Alliance"">added a condition</a> that material added by them cannot be indexed by other commercial search engines, which I find ridiculous). Their purpose was similarly to scan books, but to make them online without any restrictions, usable by any project. They have been quietly toiling away, and not making that many announcements. I am not sure quite how many books they have scanned yet. They also lack the front interface that Google has - their main site, <a href=""http://openlibrary.org"">openlibrary.org</a>, is only a technology preview of their interface (more later) and does not feature a search or even browse function for their books.</p><p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035555243@N01/93821899/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/39/93821899_b34651822b_m.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0"" /></a>However, many of the books listed under <a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/texts"">&#8220;Texts&#8221;</a> in the Internet Archive are scanned books that can be displayed using the flip-book interface (others are PDFs, text files, Word documents and so on). I find the Archive.org overview pages very little userfriendly, and confusing, so at that level Google Books is an easy win - this is obviously something that will be completely rethought and probably presented through a nice interface at openlibrary.org eventually. However, once one enters a book, whether by clicking &#8220;Read now&#8221; on the overview page, or &#8220;Flip book&#8221; on the detail page, one enters a completely simple but beautiful and highly usable interface.</p><p><strong>Flip, don&#8217;t scroll<br /></strong>One of the main problems with reading on-screen is scrolling. I have often used different apps, like <a href=""http://amarsagoo.info/tofu/"">Tofu for Mac</a>, which enables you to display any text file in columns, and flip to the next page, instead of scroll. I also often wondered why nobody - except for a few experimental design magazines - thought about producing PDFs that are designed to be viewed full-screen on a screen, rather than to be printed out. I hate trying to fit letter-sized PDFs of research reports onto my 13.3&#8243; MacBook. The default format of Google Books is like a Word document in Print Preview, although it is possible to make it two pages, and to flip between them. However, the way this is done in OpenLibrary is an incredible improvement. The scans also look much better, even preserving the yellowish hue of the aged paper, you can flip a page either by clicking on the page, or by using the arrow keys. The speed is also very high - I found it much faster at updating pages than Google, which is ironic, but obviously OpenLibrary has very few users so far.</p><p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/35034358326@N01/1069893367/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1067/1069893367_f2de895792_m.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0"" /></a>The result is that I this morning came across <a href=""http://www.openlibrary.org/details/uncletomscabinor00stowiala"">Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cottage</a> while looking for something else on archive.org, and it actually captured my attention. I began reading a little bit, turned the page, wanted to read a tad more&#8230; I&#8217;ve read it once, many years ago, but I was captured by the story again, and it was almost hard for me to put it away. The interface worked perfectly, and never got in the way. I barely thought about the fact that I was reading a book online, and not one in my lap. Compare with the <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=aU5o_QrhgPMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=uncle+tom%27s+cabin&amp;ei=drjzR7qEGJK2ygTNkYiSCg#PPA13,M1"">first hit on Google Books</a> - apart from the poor quality and a digitizer&#8217;s thumb all across one page, the interface simply does not invite one to sit down and enjoy the read at all. It&#8217;s more geared towards a quick search to find some information, which I guess comes from Google&#8217;s DNA.</p><p>I am very much looking forward to the OCA growing, and especially to finishing the openlibrary.org interface, so that we can see all the books available. It would be great if they also integrated it with other open sources, so that you could for Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cottage both see the beautiful flip book version, but also download the ASCII file from the Gutenberg Project, and listen to it through a recording from LibriVox!</p><p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/95272747@N00/137413905/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/54/137413905_9232662cf6_m.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0"" /></a><strong>Microsoft conditions<br /></strong>Searching a bit more, I found this book with <a href=""http://www.openlibrary.org/details/twentystoriesfro00grimuoft"">20 Grimm Stories</a> in Gothic German at the openlibrary.org. The scan is once again beautiful, despite a tiny transparent Microsoft watermark across the bottom of every page, and the fun part is that this book is actually from a library at University of Toronto where I study. This is the kind of source that most people without a huge research library would not have access to, and I find it wonderful to look through the book, with it&#8217;s underlinings and aged paper - giving you the feeling that you are really thumbing through a book with a very long history. However, I find the warning by Microsoft printed in it, that it cannot be indexed by commercial search engines to be despicable, and I wonder if OCA should at all work with them under these conditions. I wonder if it is even legally binding, since presumably Google does not ask for permission to index all the websites they are already indexing.</p><p>And if you are feeling frivolous, why not learn <a href=""http://www.openlibrary.org/details/artofcaricaturin006061mbp"">how to draw charicatures</a>?</p><p>Stian <small><br /><em>Thanks to </em><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/23341397@N00/352573802/"" title=""cindiann"" target=""_blank"">cindiann</a></small><small>, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035555243@N01/93821899/"" title=""Thomas Hawk"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Hawk</a></small><small>, </small><small><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/35034358326@N01/1069893367/"" title=""Celeste"" target=""_blank"">Celeste</a></small><small> </small><small>and </small><small><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/95272747@N00/137413905/"" title=""The Department"" target=""_blank"">The Department</a> for the pictures.<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/95272747@N00/137413905/"" title=""The Department"" target=""_blank""><br /></a></small></p>","What is happening with Universal Library?

There are many ways of attempting to do this, more or less successfully. I think hybrid models which mix online and &#8220;meatspace&#8221; interactions have a lot of potential for maximizing the value of time in meatspace, for example. When I first went to <a href=""http://www.icommons.org/isummit07"">iSummit</a> in Dubrovnik in 2007, I was very interested in participating in the education track, which featured a lot of breakout groups, a ban on PowerPoint, and very intense facilitation (by for example the amazing <a href=""http://www.aspirationtech.org/about/people"">Gunner</a>). However, I had never had a chance to hear luminaries like Jimmy Wales, Cory Doctorow speak Yochai Benkler live before, and I decided to go to some of their sessions instead of the education ones.</p><p>After a while I realized that because I had been watching many of their talks online earlier a) many of their ideas weren&#8217;t that new, b) I could just as well watch them after I got home from the conference. In addition, for me who knew nobody and wanted to get to know people, these sessions were not conducive at all. We sat several hundred people in a room, listened to a panel, asked a few questions, got up and left. On the other hand, in the education sessions, we brainstormed topics, sat in small groups and had intense discussions developing our thoughts. Then we went and had lunch together afterwards. The group discussion I had with Philip Schmidt and Neeru Paharia on the p2p university still shapes how I think about key questions around open learning.</p><p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/21222563@N03/2249513489/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2132/2249513489_f1ba16f466_m.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0"" /></a><small><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/21222563@N03/2249513489/"" title=""~ Last Exit ~"" target=""_blank""></a></small>In a world where flying is becoming viewed as more and more of an environmental problem, it&#8217;s crucial to intensify the experience when face2face, and save the rest for online. When I participated in the Open Translation Tools conference in Zagreb (facilitated by, not incidentally, the same Gunner), we spent an intensive five days communicating without stop - interactive, in small groups, shaped by the participants - unconference-like. We exchanged so much information, developed strong relationships, and new ideas, and arrived at conclusions and a way forward as a group. This is stuff that would have been much harder to do online. Flying to Zagreb for five days of PowerPoints would have been a complete waste.</p><p>The same thing can apply in academia. Mark E. Ott teaches physics, and he records his lectures and assigns the videos to his students. Instead of recording two hour chunks, as if he was in a classroom for two hours, he records smaller chunks of ten minutes, so that if students want to go back and review a segment, they can choose only that specific segment. He then spends the two hours he freed up of teaching time to supervise students who are working in groups with projects. This sounds to me like a much more productive way of using his time.</p><p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/16262447@N00/454863427/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/249/454863427_1d01b3830d_m.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0"" /></a><strong>Entirely online </strong><br />When it comes to events or processes conducted entirely online, I would argue that the way they are conducted needs to be fundamentally rethought to fit the medium, rather than to try to do the same as we did offline, only online. In fact, much of what we did offline - for example cramming 100 people in a room to listen to a lecturer for two hours, might not have been because we thought that was the ideal way of teaching/conveying knowledge under ideal conditions, but because of historic, spatial, temporal and economic limitations particular to the physical space. For example, it is hard to gather 100 people at the same time, so we have to teach them for a few hours to make it worth their while, etc.</p><p><a href=""http://davidwiley.com"">David Wiley</a>&#8217;s <a href=""http://www.opencontent.org/wiki/index.php?title=Intro_Open_Ed_Syllabus"">course on Open Education</a> last term was a great example of changing the format to suit the medium. Instead of recording himself speaking for two hours, and letting us view that on a tiny window on our screens pretending we were sitting in a lecture, he assigned readings on his wiki, and had us read and post our reflections on our own blogs. We then read our classmates blogs (most of which are still available, my postings are under the open-education label on this blog for example), and commented. He&#8217;d often chime in in the end with a summary and pulling the threads together, before we went to the next week. A very different format from a bricks-and-mortar class, but one that (with minor hiccups) worked remarkably well, and was by most accounts a remarkable learning experience, with very little overhead.</p><p>The <a href=""http://www.higheredblogcon.com/"">Higher Ed Blog Conference 2006</a> was also reworked completely. Presentations were posted each day over four weeks, with specific topics, however the presentations were not given live, but recorded - sometimes just an mp3, sometimes a slideshow with an mp3, or a video, etc. Participants could view these at their leisure and participate in the discussions that formed around them. I am sure there are many ways to improve on this model, but it fit my busy schedule, and I learnt a lot from being part of that &#8216;virtual learning community&#8217; for a few weeks. Making both learning and sharing of knowledge events (conferences) available online is a great way to extend participation both geographically and economically (I am very interested in a topic, and might have useful insights, but I don&#8217;t work for an institution that can fly me around the world and pay hundreds of dollars in conference fees).</p><p><strong><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1205/620312773_6613047f4a_m.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""140"" width=""240"" />Second Life - imitating meat space online?<br /></strong>Second Life has been around for several years, and I have tried it out a few times - since I keep hearing people talk about it. At iCommons in Dubrovnik there was even a panel session on using it for education, and there have been many experiments conducted and papers written on the various aspects of SL. I just never got it (and maybe that should make me feel old). I&#8217;ve logged in a few times, walked around, teleported here and there, and not found it that exciting, despite the fact that I can spend hours traversing blogs, chatting, Skypeing, and using different kinds of interactive websites. I remember thinking when iSummit in Dubrovnik was streaming live in Second Life - what is the advantage of doing this, to streaming it on a website? (Except for the fact that they can display on a big screen TV in Dubrovnik the &#8220;avatars&#8221; participating virtually). As a non-casual user of SL, I would find it a big hassle to have to log into a big application, and teleport around until I found the screen where I could stand and watch the streaming sessions, instead of pasting a URL into a browser that a friend sent me, and watch it in a tab. I am assuming that it also requires a lot more processing power and internet connection than a simple audio stream for example, which is quite relevant to how accessible this is to the entire world.</p><p>What prompted me to write this entire post was actually coming across the website of <a href=""http://www.slanguages.net/home.php"">SLanguages 2008</a>, a virtual conference on language learning in virtual worlds. I am very interested in language learning and how collaborative technologies might improve and facilitate that, however I wondered how efficient it would be to have a conference in SL, and how that would be different from just utilizing standard Web 2.0 technologies. The picture I posted above - from last year&#8217;s conference, gave me pause. For the best of me, I cannot imagine why one would want to construct an elaborate virtual 3D world, just to install a number of benches and have people sit and listen to someone speaking up front. Are we that nostalgic of the huge lectures of yesteryear? Are there not better, more intense and inclusive ways of facilitating teaching, learning, discussion and knowledge sharing online? I would probably have been more likely to participate had I not had to go into this virtual world to do it (then again, I realize this is about Virtual Worlds, and I appreciate them drinking their own Kool-Aid, but I&#8217;ve seen similar things in SL before, so the general argument still stands).</p><p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/66795748@N00/1583748092/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2114/1583748092_6c347eba3e_m.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0"" /></a>Perhaps SL is brilliant, and I just haven&#8217;t seen it yet - certainly I am very appreciative of people experimenting with all kinds of only delivery and facilitation, from this to the new course in Wikiversity on <a href=""http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Composing_free_and_open_online_educational_resources"">Composing OERs</a> which is partly inspired by David Wiley&#8217;s course. What I really hope is that they all endeavor to evaluate and document, do action research, write it up, share it - so that we can together discover new ways of communicating.</p><p>Stian<br /><em>Thanks to <a href=""http://www.photodropper.com/photos/"" target=""_blank""><small></small></a><small><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/97303475@N00/154069085/"" title=""Martin_Heigan"" target=""_blank"">Martin_Heigan</a></small><small>, </small></em><small><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/21222563@N03/2249513489/"" title=""~ Last Exit ~"" target=""_blank"">Last Exit ~</a>,</small><em><small> </small><small><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/16262447@N00/454863427/"" title=""Dean Terry"" target=""_blank"">Dean Terry</a></small><small>t, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/66795748@N00/1583748092/"" title=""r-z"" target=""_blank"">r-z</a> and</small> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/grahamstanley/"">blogefl</a> for the pictures.</em></p>",Many great free textbooks from India,"books,India,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/06/many-great-free-textbooks-from-india/,"<p><img src=""http://lh3.google.com/shaklev/R_kYEM8pN0I/AAAAAAAABYI/rrMCPhLSOBs/s288/2504dad3_Picture2020.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""288"" width=""220"" />I have written about the plan to buy the copyright for textbooks in Indonesia and publish the books online (<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/02/08/indonesian-government-wants-to-buy-text-book-copyrights/"">here</a>, and <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/03/27/indonesian-government-buys-books-copyrights-update/"">here</a>).

The first thing you get is a PDF with the contents, and at first I was very disappointed thinking that was the only thing I&#8217;d get, about to give up. Then I realized that the TOC is hyperlinked to the individual PDFs for the different chapters. However, these hyperlinks did not work neither in Preview nor in <a href=""http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/"">Skim</a>, which I usually use - I had to download Acrobat Reader to view them. I hope at some point they will make available direct links to the different chapters, or better yet, a zip file containing the whole book, for offline reading (also beneficial to those with slow internet).</p><p>The books themselves seem great. They have text books for the subjects English, Hindi and Urdu, and for many subjects they also offer a Hindi or an English version, which often seem to be identical. There are all kinds of reasons to applaud this. As a student of Hindi, I love reading the readers made for the initial grades (with beautiful illustrations!), and as I move up, I can use the texts in parallel, reading the Hindi and checking with the English that I understood. Just like I suggested that the huge amount of OpenCourseWare films of classroom lectures from all around the world, especially China and India, might be a gigantic boon to a comparative curriculum researcher, these text books would also be great for someone studying curriculum and pedagogics in India. Something similar to Bjarne Skov&#8217;s <a href=""http://wo.uio.no/as/WebObjects/theses.woa/wa/these?WORKID=59612"">very interesting analysis of elementary school textbooks in Panjab, Pakistan</a> (in Norwegian).</p><p>The thing that would make these books incredibly more useful though, is if they were affixed with a <a href=""http://www.creativecommons.org"">Creative Commons</a> license, which enabled other people to use the material and creative derivatives. This would enable me to use parts of it in my own text books, translate the text, use illustrations in Wikipedia articles, etc. There might even be a lot of Indian NGOs that wish to use part of the material, but change it in different ways to make it more locally appropriate. Licensing it under CC would be great, but it&#8217;s not enough however. The final step is to make available the source files that were used in generating the PDFs, whether those are Photoshop Layers, or InDesign files. Otherwise it will be very difficult to for example translate the text, but keep the nice background illustrations.</p><p>I hope someone like the great Sarai Foundation or Creative Commons India can talk to NCERT and see if this can be pushed through. I don&#8217;t even know if these books were written by NCERT staff, or commissioned from outside writers, who owns the copyright etc. Either way, they are beautiful, and I recommend you have a look at them. If projects from around the world write NCERT and tell them they love the books, but would like them to be freely licensed, that might trigger some Indian pride in a positive way.</p><p>Stian</p>","Espen Stranger-Johannessen => The NCERT web page seems to updated, with whole-book PDF downloads and, for the higher grades, more subjects.

They received funding from the <a href=""http://www.hewlett.org/Default.htm"">Hewlett Foundation</a> which has been funding almost all the different OpenCourseWare projects lately (they just announced <a href=""http://www.oerderves.org/?p=44"">another 10 million in funding</a> for various projects) and partly because it was a decent idea, and partly because of the stature of MIT, the idea spread widely.<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/78885901@N00/372109101/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/128/372109101_ad58a173eb_m.jpg"" border=""0"" alt="""" align=""left"" /></a>There is much to be said about the concept of OpenCourseWare in itself: the fact that it is merely a static dump of course material, and not a dynamic platform that people can collaboratively add to, and that all the material was designed for being used in offline teaching, that MIT spends several thousand dollars to get each course on the web (much of it on faculty liaisoning and clearing copyrights), that many courses have minimal materials available, that the format (PDFs, sometimes handwritten notes scanned) are not conducive to reuse and remix, that most of the readings on the reading list are closed-access and hard to get for students outside of MIT&hellip; Indeed I often wonder why developing countries who want to avail themselves of educational resources from the West, such as <a href=""http://www.core.org.cn/"">CORE</a> and <a href=""http://www.myoops.org/"">MyOOPS</a>, focus their energies so much on MIT. I think that for example <a href=""http://cnx.org"">Connexions</a>, the <a href=""http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/"">Open University in the UK</a>, and <a href=""http://www.cmu.edu/oli/"">CMU&rsquo;s Open Learning Initiative</a> offer much higher quality material for them, because it is either collaboratively edited (Connexions) or designed especially for distance learning on the web by pedagogical experts (the two others).<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/95572727@N00/2140269738/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2407/2140269738_d2c84cf5cd_m.jpg"" border=""0"" alt="""" align=""left"" /></a>This is all interesting, and I hope to research it more in the future. However, there is some great material being published under the OCW model, and the great part is that it can be very cheap - get a graduate student to film classes, avoid using copyrighted illustrations in the first place, etc. Most of the material has to be produced anyway in the process of teaching. A large number of international institutions have joined the fray (although Canada has been curiously absent, with its first participant&rsquo;s just putting out a few courses the last few days: <a href=""http://www.tofp.org/blog/?p=322"">Capilano College</a>). On the OpenCourseWare Consortium pages there is an overview of <a href=""http://www.ocwconsortium.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=26"">many countries contributing</a>,with lot&rsquo;s of universities in Japan, some in France, Korea, China, Columbia and Australia producing content, and existing courses being translated to Chinese, Thai, Spanish and Portuguese. As a higher education geek, and language lover, I find the opportunity to virtually &ldquo;sit in&rdquo; on classes from around the world very exciting.<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/77101218@N00/166090575/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/78/166090575_abc9f346b2_m.jpg"" border=""0"" alt="""" align=""left"" /></a>China, which will be hosting the <a href=""http://www.core.org.cn/en/conferences/dalian_2008/index.htm"">next OpenCourseWare Conference</a> in Dalian in April (which I will be attending), is also producing a lot of content. CORE lists <a href=""http://www.core.org.cn/core/localcourse/course_subject.aspx"">1117 courses</a> offered by various Chinese institutions, which is an incredible amount. I would wish that they could weed through the collection though, there is a certain amount of link rot, videos that will not load (or are in very obscure formats), etc. However, there is also a good amount (from random sampling) with very extensive collections of written materials, tests, class notes etc. If you want more reliable videos, Archive.org has a collection of <a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/chinese_u_lectures"">over 300 courses with full video lectures</a> (typically 5-12 lectures per class). They all work, but most are Windows Media Player or RealPlayer. my favorite is <a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/humanities54"">the course on Chinese culture in France and Russia</a>, with titles such as <a href=""http://www.archive.org/download/humanities54/4.rm"" target=""_blank"">#4 China Fever in France in the 18th Century</a>. I keep imaging subtitling that to English or French, so that French people can see what Chinese people are saying about how French people were interested in China&hellip;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/10816734@N03/2243054080/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2184/2243054080_abdca4bff8_m.jpg"" border=""0"" alt="""" align=""left"" /></a>The Indian Institutes of Technology, known globally for producing excellent graduates, have also begun providing lectures online, <a href=""http://www.rohitj.net/blog/2008/02/03/iit-coursewares-now-on-youtube-as-well/"">through YouTube</a>. An interesting example that you don&rsquo;t need to invest heavily in infrastructure or bandwidth yourself to provide these kind of services. Their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/profile_play_list?user=nptelhrd"">Youtube channel</a> provides almost only science and technology courses, whereas my interest is more on the humanities and social sciences, but for people interested they should be great. What&rsquo;s interesting is that we suddenly have people sitting at home needing to repeat for a physics class or get up to speed on thermodynamic, and they have the choice between viewing a lecture given at MIT, or a lecture on the same topic from IIT. Both will require the same (sit right where you are), and cost the same (free). Right now, people might choose MIT automatically. But maybe there will pop up some kind of social rating service, and maybe the thermodynamics course on MIT will get higher marks because of a dynamic professor, but for Intro to economics, students really prefer the IIT one, because the professor is so good at explaining?There is obviously a whole lot more to learning than just watching a lecture, but I think this ability to compare side by side could have wide-reaching implications. (Earlier, most people only ever attended one or two institutions of higher education, so it was hard to compare). I think it&rsquo;s an exciting trend, and am looking forward to supplementing my lectures on the history of higher education from OISE, with a lecture on the same topic from a Chinese university.StianThank you to <small><a title=""joiseyshowaa"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/30201239@N00/1279750389/"" target=""_blank"">joiseyshowaa</a></small>,<small> <a title=""seccad"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/78885901@N00/372109101/"" target=""_blank"">seccad</a>, </small><a title=""seccad"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/78885901@N00/372109101/"" target=""_blank""><small></small></a><small><a title=""Stuck in Customs"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/95572727@N00/2140269738/"" target=""_blank"">Stuck in Customs</a></small><small>,</small><small> </small><a title=""seccad"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/78885901@N00/372109101/"" target=""_blank""></a><a title=""Stuck in Customs"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/95572727@N00/2140269738/"" target=""_blank""><small></small></a><small><a title=""Yuek Hahn"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/77101218@N00/166090575/"" target=""_blank"">Yuek Hahn </a></small>and<small> <a title=""World Bank Photo Collection"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/10816734@N03/2243054080/"" target=""_blank"">World Bank Photo Collection</a> for the photos. </small>",Indonesian text books: First copyrights bought,"books,development,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/07/indonesian-text-books-first-copyrights-bought/,"<p>(Read about the background <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/02/08/indonesian-government-wants-to-buy-text-book-copyrights/"">here</a>, and <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/03/27/indonesian-government-buys-books-copyrights-update/"">here</a>). An update on the copyright buying project, from <a href=""http://klipingbuku.blogspot.com/"">[i:boekoe]</a>, taken from an article in Kompas, March 27, 2008.</p><p>The Department of Education has bought the copyrights of 37 books in 2007, and will buy 250 titles more in 2008. The books will then be accessible through the internet and anyone are allowed to publish and sell them cheaply. The maximum price is 7.500 Rp (0.81$) per book, says the Minister of Education Bambang Sudibyo on March 26. He believes this price is rational, because the price of printing the books is around 6.000 Rp per book, leaving enough profit for the book seller.</p><p>Currently, the books are expensive, costing around 26.000 Rp (2.8$) per book, because of the oligopoly of publishers. They control the market and work together with head masters to sell and market their text books. &#8220;I was ordered by the President to solve this problem. We are trying reform the book market thoroughly&#8221;, says Bambang Sudibyo.</p><p>The Ministry of Education will buy books from teachers with the price of 45 million Rp to 75 million Rp (4.905$ - 8.175$), which will be increased to a price of 175 million Rp (19.075$). They will be available on the internet, so anyone can download it, including schools in remote places.</p><p>If the books are to be published, there is not only the matter of the maximal price, but also conditions concerning the paper quality.</p><p>The Ministry of Education hopes that with the price of books being low, it will be easier for people to open book stores, because they will need less capital.</p><p>This policy also comes with the obligation for schools to choose books recommended by the National Education Standards Body (BSNP), and that the books be used continously for at least five years. Otherwise, the schools might receive disciplinary sanctions. In this way, we hope to overcome the problem that books are changed every year, and allow younger siblings to reuse the books.</p><p>After evaluating how successful this program is, continues the Ministry of Education, we will come up with a formula for buying copyrights for university text books. However, many of the books are in foreign languages, which are very expensive, and requires negotiation with foreign publishers.</p><p>The competition to buy copyrights has gotten teachers excited about writing, and the department will hold a training for teachers in writing books.</p><p><font color=""green"">At first, I thought they were buying the book copyrights from publishers, but now it seems that they are having teachers write the books. So why don&#8217;t they just hire a teacher to write the book - then the copyright will be theirs automatically? I am glad to see that the books will be available online, but I am still hoping for a Creative Commons license. If they are concerned about being able to impose conditions on commercial publishers, they could use a Non-Commercial license, which would allow them to specify specific conditions for commercial publishers. Ideally, you would think that just opening it up to competition would be enough to drive down the price, but there might not be enough competition in Indonesia - especially in the far-away places that are mainly targeted here. </font></p><p><font color=""green"">I think the idea is probably a good one, but there are many factors that scare me, because of the heavy-handed involvement of a government that sadly does not have an entirely positive reputation with managing similar programs, and I can certainly understand the concern of both authors and publishers. In Norway, all books until high school are free, but are bought by the school and only lent out to the students. Personally, I don&#8217;t see the need for work books in most subjects, I think that writing the answers to tasks in your notebook is just as effective (I&#8217;d be interested in hearing anything else), which means that the school can keep lending out books for several years, before they are updated. </font></p><p><font color=""green"">A separate issue is whether the schools should buy these books from book stores, or the books should be distributed directly by the MoE to schools. In Norway and many other countries, I have a feeling that the school book purchasing policy is partly a tool to support small book stores around the country, which is a valid purpose if you can afford it, but if you are a poor country and your education is really suffering, I am wondering if it is the most effective policy.</font></p><p>Stian</p>","Черноморец => Извините, как можно добавить свой материал на сайт?. 407 Indonesian textbooks openly available | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] later wrote about the official announcement of this plan, about the first copyrights being bought, and on more thoughts about the project.

"Reading list dump,"books,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/07/reading-list-dump/,"<p>I keep a list of books or articles to read. Sometimes I have kept it as a Google Mail draft, this one I transferred from there into DevonThink. It&#8217;s not structured in any way, the entries are messy, often quick copies and pastes, just enough information to be able to Google something. These are things I come across surfing, reading, which one day, I will check out. Might not read them all, but I&#8217;ll check them out. So that when I am in the library, not looking for anything in particular, I can look up this list and check out a few really interesting books. It&#8217;s worked well so far, and just having a place to dump stuff and come back to it later, makes me less overwhelmed by all the amazing interesting stuff I come across. For some reason I don&#8217;t feel stressed by the feeling that I have to read everything - it&#8217;s a resource guide, not a task list.</p><p>I don&#8217;t know how this would be useful to anyone, since it&#8217;s highly personal, chosen on the basis of what sounds interesting, now what I have already read and found useful, not annotated etc. But the marginal cost of me copying and pasting it here is extremely low, the marginal cost for you in skipping this post is also very low, and thus it only needs to be useful to one or two people within the next few years, for this to make sense. And I guess I can consider it a personal backup.</p><p>In a way, it would make a lot of sense for me keeping this in a personal wiki, viewable to the world, but I find that for tiny things like these, it takes too much time going to a wiki page, clicking edit this page, inserting it etc. GMail is always open in my browser, and DevonThink always open in my MacBook, so it&#8217;s very fast.

Broto, director of the Sekolah Penulis Pembelajar (School of Writing and Learning?).</em></p><p>It cannot be denied that the policy of the government to buy copyrights of text books, as was mentioned in the Department of Education (DoE) Policy Number 2, 2008, threatens the existence of text book publishers. However, this policy is appropriate.</p><p>Publishers have so far proved not to be good partners because they are only concerned with their own profits.</p><p>The main reason for supporting the policy of the DoE is to remember that quality and cheap education is the right of each citizen. This is important since the price of text books will certainly determine the progress and the future of our nation.</p><p>In short, this time the government should get a thumbs-up for their policy. Hopefully this policy will benefit the nation&#8217;s children and not be dirtied by short-term goals. An important point is the objectivity of the National Education Standards Body (BSNP) in choosing the books whose copyrights they will buy.</p><p>There will certainly still be protests concerning the books chosen. But this is where citizens&#8217; involvement and supervision is needed, especially to promote a mechanism that guarantees transparency.</p><p><strong>Wasting hundreds of billions</strong></p><p>So far publishers have put too much emphasis on profits, and not cared enough about the people. An example is the fact that parents have to buy new books for their children each year, because the old books cannot be used. <font color=green>[We see this all over the world.]</font></p><p>The corrupt system is like a mafia, which includes the publishers, printers, bureacrats at the MoE, intermediaries, and even head masters and school teachers.</p><p>We can imagine how such a broken system causes the wasting of hundreds of billions of rupiah each year. According to Junaidi Gafar in Kompas, March 24, in Indonesia there are about 150 publishers of text books, and their turnover averages to around 10 billion Rp ($1.09 mln) per year.</p><p>And this waste could be used to make the students smarter, and above all increase the welfare of teachers with a more sustainable method. Because of this, the policy of buying copyrights needs to be supported by all parties.</p><p>The buying of copyrights is a step towards decentralization. How can this empower many parties who until now were just spectators.</p><p>The policy can also contribute to increase the quality of education. Buying copyrights of manuscripts can induce teachers to continually work to increase their competency. This could include collaborating with other parties and develop technology to develop text books that are high quality, both in terms of contents and presentation.</p><p>In this way, the doubts about the design and editing of the books will certainly not be a problem because there are many ways of solving this. For example, collaborating with free-lance designers that there are so many of. The human resources are sufficient, both in terms of graduates of graphics academies, and printing practitioners. A better method perhaps, is to collect these books to improve the design, and carefully edit them collaboratively, before uploading them to the internet.</p><p><strong>Be clear about pushing the price</strong></p><p>Apart from all this, the buying of copyrights for manuscripts of text books for elementary school to high school is clearly going to benefit those who need books. It&#8217;s enough for them to access the internet and within short time they can get text books very cheaply.</p><p>Talking about the structure of costs for book publishers - which is reflected in the price of the books - the distribution cost is usually the biggest cost, up to 53%. Printing costs about 15%, royalties to the author 10%, and the rest is profit for the publisher.</p><p>This is assuming that the book is only printed in 3000 copies. Thus, the profit can certainly be a lot higher if it is printed in more copies. This seems to be the main objection of the publishers who have been defending unhealthy practices in the book trade until now, something that smells of corruption, collusion and nepotism (KKN).</p><p>Another thing we need to think about is the possibility that the books have ads, like newspapers and magazines. If this happens, maybe the books can be distributed among people freely, and government funding can be used for other educational activities. We just have to organize it clearly - with a reason that is responsible - which page in the book can have ads, and what kind of ads can appear in a text book. What kind of company wouldn&#8217;t be interested in sponsoring something that is printed in hundreds of thousands of copies and distributed in all of Indonesia?</p><p>The policy of the government to buy copyrights is not intended to entirely close the opportunities of the publishers, they are only asked to reduce their profits. Consumers will of course not run away if the printed products of the publishers are much better than what they can themselves print from the internet.</p><p>So it is not appropriate that some are against this policy, if they want the education of the people to progress. Isn&#8217;t it time that we utilize the advances in technology which can press down prices? Should we keep conserving a system that isn&#8217;t appropriate anymore, not effective, and hurts many people?</p><p><font color=green>It is interesting to see more analysis coming in about this topic. None of the articles have so far made reference to any similar projects other places in the world. In addition, what I am looking for is of course a recognition of new ways of authoring books, collaborating, and perhaps even moving away from the concept of a fixed national text book, to a collection of resources that teachers can compose to their own package. But perhaps that is still too advanced.</font></p><p>Stian</p>","Ethiotube: you a tube, me a tube, everyone a tube-tube","africa,languages,media,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/10/ethiotube-you-a-tube-me-a-tube-everyone-a-tube-tube/,"<p>I&#8217;ve posted some <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2007/12/10/amharic-dance-videos/"">great Amharic dance videos</a> earlier, and today I came across <a href=""http://ethiotube.net"">Ethiotube.net</a>, a Youtube clone started in February this year and describe themselves in this way:</p><blockquote><p>Founded in February 2007, EthioTube is the leader in Ethiopian online video, and the premier destination to watch and share original videos related to Ethiopia worldwide through a Web experience. EthioTube allows people, mostly Ethiopians, to easily upload and share video clips on <a href=""http://www.ethiotube.net/"">www.ethiotube.net</a> and across the Internet through websites, mobile devices, blogs, and email.</p></blockquote><p>So far, they only seem to have 81 videos online (according to the statistics), which varies widely. There are some dance videos, but also some documentaries. Here is a scary short film about a white fire and brimstone preacher who gives an Ethiopian audience the whole tele-evangelist treatment:<br /><iframe src=""http://www.ethiotube.net/embed.php?video=98"" border=""0"" frameborder=""0"" height=""370"" scrolling=""no"" width=""395""></iframe><br />And here is a clip from what looks to be &#8220;Ethiopia&#8217;s Next Great Stand-up Comedian&#8221;&#8230; I cannot understand what she says, but the judges do <em>not</em> look amused.<br /><iframe src=""http://www.ethiotube.net/embed.php?video=25"" border=""0"" frameborder=""0"" height=""380"" scrolling=""no"" width=""425""></iframe><br />Interestingly, the most viewed clip is a talk on <a href=""http://www.ethiotube.net/watch/200c36f7cd9dfd0e5dea/Dr.-Berhanu-Nega"">Ethiopian Higher Education</a>, which is approaching 800 times viewed.</p><p>What I find interesting in all this is the idea of setting up a Youtube clone for a country - or a cause. I know there is already <a href=""http://www.teachertube.com/""></a>Teachertube, partly started because Youtube is blocked in so many schools. What are the advantages and disadvantages to doing this? Should there be envirotube, gaytube, and obamatube? (Some of these exist, although with different names). There are strong local video sites in China, like <a href=""http://youku.com"">Youku</a> and <a href=""http://www.ku6.com"">Ku6</a>, but not only is the interface language completely different (and so is the language used on most of the videos of course), but there are also issues of speed of access from hosting within China, internal censorship to avoid being blocked wholesale, etc. However, the interface for Ethiotube is all in English, and many of the movies, although related to Ethiopia, are in English as well. I am not sure where the servers are located, and if that makes a difference locally - but my first hunch was that the main target group is the Ethiopian diaspora, with high-speed internet access.</p><p>On the one hand I am sure Yotube can use all the competition it can get, and creating meeting places for a diaspora is a worthy cause. On the other hand, I would never have come across the Ethiopian dance clips - or a huge amount of other crazy, improbable and wonderful clips - if it hadn&#8217;t been in one central location. And to a certain extent this reminds me of the predilection I saw in the open source community to always want to start their own applications, instead of contributing to already existing projects, or to constantly want to roll their own Linux distributions.

I thus wanted to find some statistics, and decided to examine <a href=""http://www.1001buku.org/index.php/Indonesia/Jaringan%20Perpustakaan/Daftar%20Perpustakaan/291.html"">this list</a>. It has a list of libraries, with names in bold, one line of code, and one line of address.</p><p>I copied and pasted the list to NeoOffice, but that lost formatting. I then opened the HTML file directly, which conserved formatting. Search and replace with format works great, but it only seems to allow me to replace with different formatting&#8230; I can&#8217;t really do something about the text that is formatted so? My idea was either to do a query that would delete all text that was not bold, or to insert for example 000 in front of all lines that were bold (so that I could later sort the lines, and have the bold ones come to the top. This might be possible, but if it is, I don&#8217;t know how.</p><p>Final solution: Export the document as xhtml (actually I just realized you can do this on the original HTML as well, but this is what I ended up doing), and write a quick Ruby script that spits out only the contents that is bold:</p><p><strong><em>File.read(&#8221;test.xhtml&#8221;).scan(/\&lt;span class=\&#8221;T8\&#8221;&gt;(.*?)\&lt;/) { |hit| puts hit } </em></strong><br />And voila.</p><p>(Note, if I was editing the pure HTML text in OpenOffice, I am sure I could construct an OpenOffice regexp that would let me do this. But somehow my mind is much more amenable to the &#8220;for each entry that fits this regexp criteria, give me the entry and let me do something with it&#8221;, then having to write the entire thing in regexp.)</p><p>This is why I am <em>really</em> looking forward to Ruby scripting within <a href=""http://www.koffice.org/kword""></a>KWord.

I spent a year teaching in Wuhan Scientific and Technical University in 2000-2001, and it&#8217;s the city where I first got my feet wet in China. It was a challenging, but wonderful year, and Wuhan will always hold a special place in my heart. Suffice to say that one of their most famous local dishes, which you cannot get anywhere else in China, is called hot dry noodles, or in Chinese: reganmian (热干面). I had a serving of that this morning, and it was just as I remembered it.</p><p><img src=""http://image2.sina.com.cn/book/zzw/nzt/hjt/space/big/10191809.jpg"" alt="""" width=""400"" height=""266"" /></p><p>I have spent today walking around in Wuchang, just enjoying the incredible hustle and bustle, the millions of small shops, tiny workshops, the sidewalks that often are two car-lanes wide, the crazy traffic, the smell of coal and fried dough, the old guys playing chess on the street. I have visited Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore (not yet Taiwan - though I&#8217;d love to!), but somehow in my mind nothing beats mainland China. And in mainland China, nothing beats Wuhan. It&#8217;s dirty and polluted like nothing else, the traffic is insane, you can seldom see the Yangtze river when riding a bus over the ain bridge over it, people swear and spit and shout in a dialect of Mandarin that is almost incomprehensible, but I somehow love it. It&#8217;s got an incredible energy, and some kind of &#8220;raw urbanism&#8221; that I missed intensely in the sprawling slum areas of Jakarta.</p><p>Nobody owns a house in Wuhan (or most Chinese cities) - there are no single-dwelling houses. Everyone has an apartment, whether in an eight storey creaking apartment block with edges and windows and laundry hanging everywhere, or a smooth newer building. Almost nobody own their own car - there is not a single parking lot here (thank god!). My friend lives in a tiny studio apartment, with a simple toilet and kitchen, and pays 230 RMB a month ($32 USD). When she walks into the street she is in the middle of busy restaurants, and there are five buses stopping in front of her apartment. I&#8217;d take that over a bigger apartment on a highway in Scarborough any day of the week!</p><p><strong>What has changed?<br /></strong>China changes so fast that it&#8217;s almost impossible to keep up, and I was very curious when coming back to Wuhan if I&#8217;d notice any changes, 7 years after I lived here (I was back for a week in 2004). The truth is - not much. (Of course, Beijing, for example, has been developing much faster). There seem to be more air-conditioned buses, and there is more advertising around. Many of the buses have plasma screens that show advertising all the time, as well as as a scrolling marquee sign that lists kind of &#8220;classified ads&#8221; (more informative, about events, prices of surgery at the local hospital, and exhortations to look to both sides when crossing the street). None of these carry any information about where the bus will stop next etc (but most buses make voice announcements). A lot of the taxis even have a scrolling marquee sign in the back window facing out, with ads.</p><p><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://www.wh-china.com/whxw/200711/W020071128315118065466.bmp"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""155"" />The Wuchang train station was torn down, and on the other side of the street, they are almost finished building a new one, that is <em>huge</em> and very fancy. I already mentioned that there seems to be more limitations on internet usage (at least in internet cafes), and I have problems using GMail for example, not to mention Meebo or other foreign webpages. This might bea temporary problem leading up to the Olympics.</p><p>Food prices have seen a huge increase to almost the double, since 2004. This is notable especially since from 2001 to 2004 there was no difference at all. Fried lamian now cost 10 yuan, up from 5. Reganmian never cost more than 1.2, now cost 2.5. A plate of suanla tudousi (hot and sour potato stripes) used to cost3-5, now often 8. Partly this is probably due to the international rise in food prices.If calculated in terms of Norwegian Kroner (NOK) though, the rise isn&#8217;t so big,because the yuan has lost value to the NOK (in 2001 it was almost at parity, now it&#8217;s 0.7 yuan toone NOK).</p><p>I am planning to blog quite a bit about the conference, but not sure when Iget a chance. Internet cafes are a bitannoying,very noisy,dark, smoke-filled,with poor keyboards,only Internet Explorer, andfrequent timeouts of foreign websites. Andmost seem to have disabled the USB drives (to avoid people to load viruses I guess), so I cannot even upload an article I wrote on mylaptop.

They are often huge, and buzzing with activity. The biggest are often called &#8220;book cities&#8221;, and the one I visited in Shenzhen a year ago was about six huge floors. On the Sunday that I visited it, it was packed with people, sitting on everywhere voraciously reading. A big difference between Indonesian bookstores is that in China, the books are almost never wrapped in plastic, and it is totally accepted to spend hours sitting in the bookstore reading books.</p><p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.yunhe.gov.cn/zhxx/tpxw/W020050717342146023507.jpg"" alt="""" width=""387"" height=""500"" /></p><p>When buying any book, but in particular when buying a book in a language that I am still learning, it&#8217;s very important to me to be able to look through the book and see the contents, and the level of the language. In Indonesia, I often had to surreptiously take the wrapping off books, without the attendants noticing, so that I could examine the contents (everyone did this), but in China you can collect a few books that look interesting, sit in the window sill, and spend a leisurely half an hour looking through to determine which you would like to buy.</p><p>The range of books is amazing, and almost absolutely everything is in Chinese, of course. There are usually extremely few English books, except for a few out-of-copyright bilingual versions (Wuthering Heights, etc) for language learners. (I wonder if CC China could work with publishers to publish bilingual versions of some modern CC licensed novels? It ought to be a lot more interesting for the young English learning audiences to read Cory Doctorow novels, than Gone With the Wind&#8230; Not sure if he is using non-commercial though).</p><p><strong>English-language intro to Chinese ideologies?</strong><br /><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://book.kaoyantj.com/kaoyanimg/2004111516263.jpg"" alt="""" width=""242"" height=""346"" />I always find it interesting looking around in the government section, with lot&#8217;s of training material for government exams for people who want to work at different levels - this of course includes political exams. I thought it was very fascinating, the first time I came to China, to see their extensive multiple choice exams on Marxism for example.</p><p>One thing that I have thought before, and which I was reminded of looking through the political books is this: Are there any books in English at all which attempt to explain the ideologies of China? I remember when I first lived in China, wishing that I could one day meet a Chinese who was a convinced communist, or convinced of the ideology of the party, and could really explain to me. I wouldn&#8217;t even try to argue - just listen and try to understand.</p><p>Because for someone who knows at least a little bit of Marx, and has been active in left-wing political parties in Norway, where this was discussed, it is very interesting to see how China&#8217;s ideologues can justify China&#8217;s current development. Once again - I am not trying to attack or ridicule, but rather to understand. I know that in Chinese there is a huge amoung of ideological training material, political philosophy books etc, but the language is quite confusing, especially for someone who didn&#8217;t go through political education in high school and university.</p><p>With the increasing importance of China, you&#8217;d think that it would be important to really try to understand these ideologies for Westerneras. Even if most Chinese might not actually believe in them, they still function as the official guidelines of the government, and are still taught to hundreds of millions of people every year in schools and workplaces.</p><p><strong>New developments</strong><br /><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://www.douban.com/lpic/s2612164.jpg"" alt="""" width=""288"" height=""459"" />The bookstore I visited in Dalian was quite similar to what I remembered from 7 years back, but there were two new developments. One was a number of Lonely Planets in Chinese. I am quite sure these did not exist back then, and they are an interesting indicator of the greater wealth of Chinese, and thus the much larger group of Chinese who are able to travel overseas. As well - how many choose to, and are able to do so, independently - because a Lonely Planet is not that useful, if you are on a tour bus the whole time.</p><p>I am wondering whether the content is simply the normal Lonely Planet translated, or whether there is stuff added/edited to suit a Chinese audience (Chinese restaurants?). I also wonder whether most of the people who buy them are actually going to backpack overseas, or whether it&#8217;s also bought by people who like to dream about doing so. (I&#8217;ve certainly enjoyed reading the Lonely Planet for India long before I actually got a chance to go there).</p><p>The other thing I noticed was a series of Chinese-language graded readers for Chinese learners. This is a brilliant development, which might be very useful for students of Chinese. The introductory text explained that they had produced 60 titles, with different levels of difficulty. The easiest books only use the 300 most common words in Chinese (not sure how many characters this corresponds to), as well as introduction 1-2% of new words that are glossed at the bottom of each page. There are also introductions to each story in the beginning, to set the context. The most advanced books include up to 5000 words (or characters?).</p><p>I am a huge believer in getting people to &#8220;break the reading code&#8221; in Chinese as early as possible, and I think these graded readers can be a very useful tool. I really hope that Chinese institutions around the world will stock up on these - they certainly are not expensive.</p><p>Stian<br /><em>(PS: I wrote this a few days ago on my laptop, but this is the first internet cafe that actually would read my USB key and let me post it).</em></p>","Chinese Bookshop => Sorry for the late reply to your post.

The news that Eslite is moving to mainland China is fantastic, although I think it&#039;ll take some time for people to use bookshops in the same way that they are used in Taiwan. . hsknotes => What&#039;s the &#039;reading code&#039; for chinese language learners exactly?. "Anatomy of a Chinese 网吧 (cybercafe),"china,personal,tech,travel,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/29/anatomy-of-a-chinese-%e7%bd%91%e5%90%a7-cybercafe/,"<p>One of the most striking things in China, and a very important feature for foreigners, is the ubiquitous cybercafes. I made heavy use of them the first time I was living in China, in 2000-2001, when I had no internet at &#8220;home&#8221; (in the student dormitory). The second time, when I was living in Hangzhou, I had broadband internet at home, but still used them occasionally. And of course, on this trip, all my surfing has been done through cybercafes. They have changed extremely little since 2001, which is interesting for a technology that is in so rapid development. Here are some superficial thoughts (based only on own experiences, not on any study or external sources).</p><p><strong>Description<br /></strong>You can find cybercafes in any city in China, however they almost never have English signs (why would they?). Most of them are called 网吧 (wangba) or internet bar, but some have more innovative names. Usually there is a sign on the street and a staircase leading to a basement, or the second floor of a building. Once you enter, it&#8217;s a very large room that might hold 100-200 computers. Near the entrance is a desk, which also sells snacks and cold drinks. There are many signs at the entrance about people under 18 not being allowed access, and there are rules about the minimum distance between schools and cybercafes.</p><p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://news3.pcnow.com.cn/2/lib/200608/02/271/1100.jpg"" alt="""" width=""420"" height=""340"" /></p><p>I don&#8217;t have membership at any cybercafe, so I go to the desk, pay 10 RMB deposit, and receive a card with a username and a code. Regulars have their own accounts, and don&#8217;t need to &#8220;check in&#8221; like this. In recent years, internet cafes are supposed to check your ID and write down your details before letting you log on. I am not sure how much this is enforced - since I am a foreigner they mostly don&#8217;t bother, although one or two has asked to see my passport.</p><p>You can then choose any computer. Two things have changed slightly since 2001. Firstly, the computers are turned off between customers, probably to save electricity (often the occupancy is far under 100%). I am guessing there might have been some central edict about this, because it never was the case before, and now it has been at every single place I visited. So I choose a location, turn on the computer, which boots Windows XP (in a few cases Vista). All the cafes use a cybercafe management software to deal with login and accounting. I type in my password and get the Windows desktop. Often number of icons are limited etc.</p><p>Not a single cybercafe I have visited so far had Firefox, which is very frustrating. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I had to use Internet Explorer for any extended amount of time. This should be a huge opportunity for some Chinese open source advocacy group - we are talking potentially hundreds of millions of new users here!</p><p>The computers are all stand-alone tower computers, with fairly large screens, and headphones (sometimes headsets). It&#8217;s interesting that they never experiment with multi-head computers, but one of the reasons (apart from the fact that they are running Windows) could be that the computers are frequently used for gaming. Many cybercafes seem to have disabled the USB drive, which is very frustrating, when trying to write an article on your laptop, and post it online at the cybercafe.</p><p><strong>Internet access<br /></strong><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://www.foxnews.com/images/327233/1_61_china_military_tech.jpg"" alt="""" />The one who can understand China&#8217;s internet policy will get a prize from me - it&#8217;s highly erratic. Generally speaking, they block far more Chinese controversial webpages, than English ones, however there seem to be a lot more pages blocked this time than the last time I was in China. Often whole newspapers, or whole blog hosts are blocked for just one article/blog. This is the advantage of having your own domain I guess (reganmian is still not blocked). Worse than that, using foreign Web 2.0 applications is very slow - I could not manage to play a video on Youtube, even though it did display, and GMail is highly erratic, Meebo and other IM clients don&#8217;t work at all. Of course, China has a huge amount of Web 2.0 applications themselves, and they all load very fast. The advantage of having people post their pictures, videos and blogs on Chinese sites, is of course that the government has much more fine-grained control with this.</p><p><strong>Users</strong><br /><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://www.profy.com/wp-content/images/phil7/2007_09_17t023316_450x293_us_china_internet_death.jpg"" alt="""" />Almost all users are young males, with the occasional female. This probably depends a lot on where it is located - at the cybercafes near the university where I taught, the gender balance was a lot more equal. Generally the environment is quite &#8220;male friendly&#8221; - dark, very smoke filled (there is an ashtray next to every computer), and often noisy. The two main activities are playing online games (Counterstrike was the most popular back in the days, not sure what is hot these days), and watching videos online. People who play online games can be quite noisy, shouting into their headsets, and to their friends on the next row over.</p><p><strong>Local services</strong><br />An interesting detail is that cybercafes also provide local storage of popular media - to save bandwidth and offer better service. There is often an icon on the frontpage to a page hosted on 192.168.x.x (local server, not available on the internet), with fancy webpages offering access to hundreds of movies, TV shows, music etc. This is all for watching online. I just watched a two hour German movie about a huge fire in a tower, the quality was quite good. Since the webpages are so professional, I am assuming that there is a company that designs these local media solutions and sells/rents them to the internet cafes, it would be interesting to know how this works - how it gets updated etc. (Of course, it wouldn&#8217;t stand very long against the copyright police).</p><p><strong>Pricing and economy</strong><br />The price of going online hasn&#8217;t changed since 2001, although the price of food has almost doubled. It&#8217;s still usually 2 yuan per hour (30 cents with today&#8217;s exchange rates). Some cafes actually have one row of computers that only offer games, and the local media server, at a cheaper rate. I think - but have no evidence for this - that the cafes are usually individually owned. At least, I have never seen any evidence of any chains. There is very little differentiation except for in Beijing and Shanghai, where you might find more upscale, and cleaner cafes, for more money. The initial investment for hundreds of computers capable of gaming must be huge, and I wonder how quickly the recoup it. One important detail is that the cafes usually stay open 24 hours a day (labor is very cheap, so it makes sense to exploit the capital). Students at my university would often stay up all night, because it was the only place girls and boys could hang out together - the dormitory closed it&#8217;s doors at 11, and girls could never go to visit boys rooms. There was a special rate from 11PM to 7AM.</p><p><strong>Final thoughts</strong><br />I wonder how the market for internet cafes is developing. The very specific target group makes it clear that many people access the internet from other places. One factor is that it has become very much more common to get broadband internet at home, and I wonder if many universities now offer this in dormitories too (I don&#8217;t know about the last one). Even in my friend&#8217;s apartment building, where rooms cost only 40$ per month and are absolutely tiny, with no amenities (no hot water, heating, etc), there are many who have broadband internet (I saw notices posted on the wall). Others access it through teir office. As far as I know, wireless internet access is still very rare, but this might be changing - and is probably very different in Beijing and Shanghai.</p><p>Stian</p>","Chongqing, Hechuan via Beijing to Linqing","china,personal,travel,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/05/13/chongqing-hechuan-via-beijing-to-linqing/,"<p>I thought I&#8217;d write a little more about my last travels. The last time I wrote, I was in Wuhan, and much has happened since that. In China, the 1st of May is celebrated as the workers&#8217; holiday - not with parades and marches of workers demanding their rights like is common in Europe - but with a few days off. Any nationally coordinated holiday in China is a huge logistical challenge, trying to move a few hundred million people who want to get back home - especially rural migrant workers, but also students studying in another city etc. I left for Chonqing on the 2nd of May, and was lucky to be able to upgrade to a hard sleeper at 1AM, because the hard seat section was completely overfilled, and quite uncomfortable.</p><p><strong>Chongqing</strong><br />In Chongqing, I was meeting up with an old student of mine, who has now gone on to become an English teacher herself. I had never been to Chongqing before, but knew that it was one of the cities that had received the most of the relocated villagers from the Three Gorges area, and was growing very rapidly. Later I realized that the Chongqing municipality, with its 30 million people, is probably the largest municipality in the world. The size, though, underlines the problem with defining &#8220;the biggest city in the world&#8221;, since the boundaries of a city are hard to define - the municipality is the size of Austria, and contains a lot of rural areas. The dense city core itself contains around four million inhabitants.</p><p>It&#8217;s an interesting city to walk around in, because it&#8217;s very hilly - not very common in big Chinese cities. I kind of like hilly cities, because they provide for interesting walks, sudden vistas, crooked roads and so on. In Chongqing&#8217;s case, it also provides for a huge amount of big bridges, and a city that often seems &#8220;layered&#8221; - at one stage we took an escalator a few hundred meters down from one &#8220;level&#8221; to another (on what was, my friend proudly told me, the world&#8217;s longest escalator).</p><p>The city was in rapid expansion, with new fancy highrises being built everywhere. We took our afternoon tea in a bizarre rainforest themed cafe, with lush plants, and once every ten minutes the sprinkler system in the middle would erupt, to canned sounds of tropical wildlife. In the middle of the concrete jungle in Chongqing&#8230; Then we enjoyed a cable-car ride over the Yangtze river, which is more or less as polluted here as it is when it gets further downstream in Wuhan, but here it&#8217;s much thinner.</p><p><strong>The Western People Street<br /></strong><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://photo.yupoo.com/haibo/36012556dc78/small/"" alt="""" width=""240"" height=""180"" />Yangrenjie (洋人街), or the Western People Street, is a bizarre fun park in Chonqing, that is still under construction (or at least I hope it&#8217;s not done yet). After the cab driver dropped us off, we had to walk for twenty minutes on a very rickety road, before we reached the park, which was packed with people - since it was during the holidays, and it didn&#8217;t honestly seem like Chongqing had that many other places worth going on an outing to. There was an upside-down house, with an Indian restaurant in it, lot&#8217;s of people selling cowboy hats and sugarfloss (I got a pink one!), some petting horses, a castle, a brick installation that was supposed to look like Manhattan, a ton of outdated slogan signs, &#8220;the world&#8217;s largest toilet&#8221;, and a whole lot of noise. I kept thinking &#8220;I hope this isn&#8217;t how Chinese really picture a Western street&#8221;&#8230;</p><p><strong>Hechuan<br /></strong>After enjoying Chongqing, we took a one hour bus ride to Hechuan, where my friend&#8217;s family lives. I had wonderful food, and it&#8217;s always fun to see your friends&#8217; homes. On the second day, my friend had to leave to go back to work, and I staid behind with her parents for another night, because my train wasn&#8217;t leaving yet. That night, her parents took me to the street by the river, full of restaurants, where the locals liked to enjoy life in the evenings. We had great food, beer, and once the father had downed two baijiu&#8217;s (pretty strong Chinese alcoholic drink) he began talking about philosophy, history and critical thinking. He didn&#8217;t care much for Marx he said, but he was a huge fan of Hegel, and his dialectical thinking. I love coming across older Chinese that have lived for a while and have their own ideas and experiences, so I found the conversation very interesting - although my philosophy vocabulary is still a bit limited - I kept looking for the Chinese words for utilitarianism and rule ethics.</p><p><strong>Via Beijing<br /></strong>After Hechuan, I left to start my volunteer work with <a href=""http://ruralchina.org"">Rural China Education Foundation</a>. I was going to a village in Shandong province, and had to transit through Beijing. So I spent 24 hours on the train to Beijing (was able to upgrade to a sleeper from the very beginning). Most of the time I was lying on my bed, looking at the very mountaineous Chinese countryside outside, and listening to a Swedish crime thriller. Kind of absurd. I arrived at Beijing West station in the morning, bought a ticket to Linqing for that evening, dropped my luggage and went downtown.</p><p>I had no real plans in Beijing, and also no travel guide or anything. I decided to head straight for the Tian&#8217;anmen square, just because that&#8217;s the first place I visited in China back in 2000, and I thought it would be fun to go back. I visited the People&#8217;s Great Hall, where the 3000+ people&#8217;s representatives gather each year to rubber-stamp government decisions. Then I decided I wanted to go find the new fancy Olympic constructions - the swimming hall and the bird&#8217;s nest. At the Tian&#8217;anmen metro station, they had a great overview over possible interesting tourist locations and how to go there - which metro station to go to, which bus to switch to.</p><p>So I took the metro to a certain station, but there the clues ended - the bus I was supposed to take didn&#8217;t exist, and there was no more indication for tourists. Perhaps that will exist before the Olympics. I took a bus that purported to go to some Olympic area, and got off at that station, but could not find what I was looking for. I wandered around for a while, and chanced upon the China Ethnic Minorities Museum, which I decided to visit just for fun. The museum is built after a similar idea of the Taman Mini (Small Garden) in Jakarta, with small areas representing the 56 different official minorities in China. Each area had representative buildings from that ethnic minorities, and some posters describing their lives. There were also dance exhibitions, and souvenirs. The whole was kind of kitschy, although it was interesting to see some of the dances.</p><p><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://photo.yupoo.com/redstone2005/714724b5e919/small/"" alt="""" width=""240"" height=""189"" />The most interesting part, however, was that when I walked over a big &#8220;ethnic&#8221; bridge, I saw the Bird&#8217;s Nest from afar. Finally. I exited the museum, and was finally able to get a good look at both the Bird&#8217;s Nest, and the Swimming Hall, that are next to each other. They were still working around them, so I couldn&#8217;t get too close, but it was still fun to think that the world&#8217;s attention would be focused right here in a few months (when I will be far away, in a small village in India).</p><p>One thing that I noticed about Beijing, since I first came there in 2000, is the enormous expansion of the metro system. At that time, I think they only had one or two metro lines, that were very constrained to the inner ring road. It was also much more expensive to ride the metro than the buses, so people still preferred buses, contributing to incredible gridlock in rush hour traffic. During the last few years, they have been building feverishly, especially adding lines up to the Olympics, but also planning ambitiously ahead. Currently, Wikipedia gives the NY subway system, at 370 km, as the largest in the world, with Moscow Metro at 293 km. The Beijing metro is today 142 km, but before the Olympics, a further 58 kilometers of rail will be opened - and before 2012 and 2015 they are adding a number of extra lines. This is incredibly positive, and will hopefully do much to alleviate traffic and pollution, and make Beijing commutes easier.</p><p>In the evening, I had dinner with a friend, and left on the late train to Linqing.</p><p>Stian</p>","Guido => Beijing made a lot of progress these last few years.

This report was written for RCEF and based on their needs, and my observations. I am releasing it publicly, because it might offer interesting ideas or insights to others. I have anonymized the site locations, and the persons involved. Any information about RCEF programs can be gotten through their <a href=""http://ruralchina.org"">website</a>.</em></p><p><img src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/files/frontpage.jpg"" alt="""" width=""428"" height=""333"" /></p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p><p>In May 2008, I visited two Rural China Education Foundation field sites. I wanted to examine the evolution of their relatively recent library programs, and see if I could make any suggestions. Site 1 was located in Shangdong province, and Site 2 in Shanxi.</p><p><strong>My involvement</strong><br />I spent six full days in Site 1, arriving on May 6th and leaving on May 12th. I lived in an empty house behind the village head&#8217;s house. I spent four days at the primary school, listening in on classes, and talking to students and teachers. I also taught a few English classes, and participated in a parents-teacher meeting. I met with the reading committee three times, and the reading committee arranged for me to meet with a number of readers from the village at a &#8220;mass meeting&#8221; in the school. I was supposed to do an English corner in the weekend, but I think the information was poorly announced, and only one student showed up.</p><p>I spent May 13th to 20th at Site 2 school. I lived in an office at the village government compound, and spent all my time at the school. I listened in on classes, taught a few classes, observed students using the library, and spent a lot of time talking to the RCEF volunteers there, as well as talking to the teachers and interacting with the students. Together with the RCEF volunteers, I also visited a farmer&#8217;s organization in a nearby village, including their library, and their handweaving cooperative.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong><br />I will describe each field site, the current library situation as I perceived and was told, and the feedback that I received from the teachers, children and villagers at each place. At the end, I will provide some of my own suggestions for the future. I will provide more background information about Site 1 than about Site 2, because there are permanent RCEF volunteers at Site 2 that understand the place very well. Note that much of what I report here is what I have been told by only one informant, and might not be correct - it should be quite clear what is based on my own observation, and what I was told. As for my suggestions, evaluating whether they are appropriate or not is dependent on a deeper understanding of the teachers, students and villagers, and they are offered with the hope that RCEF members will be able to evaluate which might be practicable and not based on their deeper understanding of the dynamics at the field sites than I was able to gain.<br /><span id=""more-225""></span><br /><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Report from Site 1</strong></span></p><p><strong>Village</strong><br /><img src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/files/machine.jpg"" alt="""" width=""411"" height=""548"" />There are officially 1400 inhabitants in the village, but actually 1800 - 400 are &#8220;unregistered&#8221;. About 70% of the families are economically doing well, and 30% are not doing so well. Many of the older people are illiterate (half of the over 60&#8217;s, some of the over 40&#8217;s). There are large gaps in education between men and women among older people. The head of the village took over as village head in 2001 when they began with democratic elections. The economic situation has improved after they began a market for used machine parts from factories. Shandong is richer than the Western provinces, but Site 1 is in one of the poorest corners of Shandong. According to the principal at the primary school, the villagers that do farming and trading make at least 30,000 yuan per year, whereas the villagers who only do farming might make as little as 10,000 yuan per year. There are lots of opportunities for &#8220;dagong&#8221; (looking for factory jobs etc) in the area, so not many migrate far away.</p><p><strong>Village head</strong><br />The head of the village lives in a very simple house - the principal, who is a friend of him, says that if he had not been a village head, he could have made a lot of money, and that his poverty was proof that he wasn&#8217;t corrupt. He has a lot of books and magazines about development of the countryside lying around, the old guys from the reading committee seemed to often hang out there, and read some of the material. He has been five years in the army, and lived in many places in China. He says he is the most highly educated at his age in the village.</p><p><strong>School system</strong><br />There is an elementary school in Site 1. The middle school is very close by. The high school is in a township, not that far away. Finally, there are about 20 university students in the village.</p><p>Since last year, the schools don&#8217;t require any student fees (which the principal was proud about), only 15-20 RMB per year for the notebooks (the textbooks are free). According to the principal, there was virtually 100% enrollment in primary and secondary school. As for high school (gaozhong), he said that any student that wanted, could get in, but many parents chose to keep the children at home to put them to work when they reached that level. There are also a bit more boys than girls attending high school, but the situation is better than before.</p><p><strong>Elementary school</strong><br /><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/files/kids-square.jpg"" alt="""" width=""424"" height=""318"" />The principal also teaches science. He has gone to the RCEF training in Beijing, and was proud of being a &#8220;member&#8221; of RCEF. The school has 13 teachers, 10 are &#8220;real&#8221; teachers with more or less than a specialization in teaching, whereas 3 are &#8220;daike laoshi&#8221; - villagers that don&#8217;t have any higher education or teacher training, and are paid much less (280 yuan per month). The teachers are paid between 1000 and 1700 yuan per month. The schedule is daily from about 7:30 to 12, then a three hour break when the students and teachers return home to eat and sleep, and teaching proceeds again from 15 to 18 - 18:30. I asked if some of the time during the &#8220;lunch break&#8221; could be used for activities, but they said that was very difficult, everyone wanted to eat and sleep.</p><p>The school has 200 students (counting the kindergarten), and has won the best school in the district for the last 7 years, which they are very proud of. It is also the smallest school in the district. Many students from other areas would like to enroll, but are unable to, since it is based on where you live.</p><p>A very positive aspect is that they seem to really encourage continual improvement and peer-critique, with a system of teachers listening in on other teachers&#8217; classes (sometimes even across schools). During the last teachers&#8217; meeting on Friday, they distributed who would listen in on whose classes during the next week. I never heard anyone provide feedback on what they had seen though - but this might be done in private to save face, etc. The principal presented it as the school having always been quite good, open-minded, etc, but with the RCEF volunteers in the summer, they had received a &#8220;real boost&#8221;. His superior, who was visiting to listen in on classes, also said that he noted a &#8220;new atmosphere&#8221; in the school after the RCEF summer volunteers - hard to tell if he was being sincere though.</p><p>One teacher I talked to, when asked what he wanted in terms of future training, said he would love to visit other schools to see how they teach - especially city schools.</p><p><strong>Use of computers</strong><br />They have two computers, with a quite fast internet connection. The teachers stated that they often used the internet to look up information etc. However, they did not seem very internet savvy, and I am sure some training in information finding, judging what material is reliable, etc, would be useful. They also have incredibly slow typing speeds - the principal spent a lot of time typing up a report or something. Some of the more wealthy villagers also have computers (I visited one such family - according to their bookmarks, they mainly watched movies online, and got information about weather etc). The cheapest computers cost around 3000 yuan, but according to the principal, a larger obstacle was the fee to connect the computers to the internet, which might be more than 1000 RMB per year.</p><p><strong>Impressions of RCEF volunteers</strong><br />Everyone I met seemed to be very excited about the RCEF volunteers that had been there in the summer (zhijiao). They showed me lot&#8217;s of pictures, and always talked about them. Especially an American volunteer came up a lot, and I was often asked if I knew him. The students said they had liked the volunteers a lot, especially the fun English classes and the hands-on science classes. They also believed that the teachers were getting &#8220;better and better&#8221; since the RCEF volunteers had been there. (Their main complaint was against teachers that used physical punishment frequently).</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Library </strong></span></p><p>The library was started by RCEF volunteers from Shandong university in March 2008.</p><p><strong>Custodian<br /></strong>If I understood correctly, there was originally an older teacher who lives in the school building (the only one) who was in charge of the library, however - possible because he or someone in his family had been sick for a month, and he had been away - the main responsibility now seemed to rest on a young local teacher.</p><p><strong>Physical location</strong><br /><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/files/g-library.jpg"" alt="""" width=""411"" height=""548"" />The library is stored in a small room with two shelves. The room is kept locked and the young teacher, as well as some from the reading committee (dushihui) have keys. The books all seemed to be in very good condition (not strange since the library has not been open for very long). The library holds books both for children and for adults in the village. Each book is marked with a category, and a unique number.</p><p><strong>Procedure for students</strong><br />The students are not allowed into the room, but every Wednesday they can choose from a list of the whole book collection - a teacher then goes and fetches the book immediately. This list only contains the code (including the category), the title of the book, and the price. Currently there is only one printed list in the entire school. I never got to witness the actual distribution, but it seems clear from interviews that the teacher handling the distribution - often the young teacher - plays a guiding role in the selection, for example suggesting certain books that might be relevant to their studies and preventing them from accessing books that she deems inappropriate for them (for example books about ghosts or other scary things). They said that in the future each teacher would have a copy of the list, and would perhaps be able to arrange borrowing for his/her own class. All borrowings are written in a notebook, with the name of the student, and the name/number of the book borrowed. This makes it very easy to get a quick count of how many books have been borrowed (the students and teachers are noted in one side of the book, and starting from behind, are the names of the villagers, and the books they have borrowed).</p><p>The students do not pay deposits for the books, but they have to pay the cost of a book if it is lost. This has happened one time so far. Some secondary school students who know about the library also come directly to the young teacher to borrow books.</p><p><strong>Feedback from students</strong><br />They like to read tonghuashu (children&#8217;s stories), gushishu (story books) and zuowenshu (essay books?). When shown examples, these categories looked very similar to me, but I was told by the students that zuowenshu can help them with their schoolwork. One of the common desires of the students is that they be able to enter the library. They would also like more books - since some of the most popular are often lent to someone else. They would all like to be able to read magazines, and their families never bought them any. I asked if they had any books in their homes, and they all said that there were no books, except for school textbooks. They had been to the bookstore in the township (a bikeride away), but only to buy school supplies etc.</p><p><strong>Feedback from teachers</strong><br />The principal, when asked about the success, said &#8220;Although having a library in itself is already a big success, when it comes to promoting the use, we are still in the very beginning phases.&#8221; They didn&#8217;t have a place large enough for all the students to enter, and he was also very worried about control, and books disappearing. Several of the teachers did borrow books on teaching methods, and they would like more books on this topic.</p><p>One young teacher was reading &#8220;Optimistic teaching&#8221;, and said it helped her whenever she was depressed in her teaching. She also said that in total she read a lot more, now that they had the library, because there was often a lot of &#8220;downtime&#8221; during the day, and she always kept a book in her drawer ready to be read. They also said they would like more &#8220;tool books&#8221; (gongjushu), like dictionaries, encyclopaedias etc. However, given the procedure for using the library right now, that doesn&#8217;t seem very helpful (one would have to &#8220;check out&#8221; a dictionary for two weeks to look something up).</p><p>One young Chinese teacher said the library was great. He used to read a bit every day for his fifth grade students from a novel that he loved, and he said he couldn&#8217;t have done that if the library wasn&#8217;t there to provide the book (I later observed him reading in class from this book). He also underlined that more books were needed, because students got frustrated when the books they wanted to borrow were not available. He said he often tested his students orally on the books they had borrowed to see if they had actually read them. He also suggested having a quite corner reserved for reading somewhere, for those students who wanted to read during breaks etc, because the classroom often got very messy and loud (which I also observed).</p><p>The young teacher, who is now responsible for the lending to students, said that having the students enter the library would be impossible, they were far too wild, and would drag apart books that two students both wanted to borrow, etc. The sixth grade was the worst, the younger students might be a bit better behaved, she said.</p><p><strong>Procedure for villagers</strong><br />The villagers are usually introduced to the library by the 12-15 members of the reading committee who tell their friends and neighbours etc about it. They have one copy of the book list, and stated that they often introduced appropriate books to people depending on what they worked with, for example books on growing vegetables, books on raising animals, or on fixing machines (because of the used machines market). The reading comittee then goes to the library to get the book for the villager (as far as I understand, they have a key to the library, but not to the school gates. maybe the old man living in the school can open in the evening).</p><p>The reading committee never mentioned this, but the young teacher told me that some villagers that had already &#8220;understood the system&#8221; would come to find her directly at the school to borrow books. The same with some middle school students that didn&#8217;t have a library at their school. However, this was difficult, because the school gates are locked during school hours, and the young teacher is often busy teaching, etc.</p><p>The villagers pay a deposit for the books according to the price of the book rounded up to the nearest whole yuan. This is returned to them, if they return the book in a good condition.</p><p><strong>Reactions from the reading committee</strong><br />When asked if they didn&#8217;t think it was a lot of bother (mafan) to have to go get the books for the villagers, they said they didn&#8217;t mind (bu pa mafan), and that they were especially inspired by the RCEF volunteers that had been there in the summer - if these young people can work so hard for free, then we old people should make a contribution as well. They said that both young and old people borrowed books, but a bit more men than women. They would like more books about machines (including how to repair them), raising animals and growing crops, how to live healthy, cooking - what different dishes go together, etc.</p><p>One member suggested that they take some relevant books with them when they go around to the villagers, and that in this way, the villagers would be more easily enticed to borrow books. They also wanted to hold more &#8220;mass meetings&#8221; to promote the library. They are quite happy with the general procedures for the library, said that the RCEF volunteers put down so much &#8220;blood and sweat&#8221; to write them, so that we shouldn&#8217;t change them easily.</p><p><strong>Statistics</strong><br />So far only one book has been lost, and the price was compensated by the student&#8217;s family. The library has been open for about 1,5 months (opened 2,5 months ago, but was not operational for one month because of sickness in the family of a key person). So far, roughly 160 books have been borrowed by students (and teachers). Although there are 200 students (including kindergarten) at the school, the teachers said that the lowest grades never borrowed books, and that the &#8220;borrowing public&#8221; might be around 140 students, which indicated a bit over one borrowed book per student in 1,5 months. When I talked informally with students, fourth grade students indicated that they had borrowed 1-2 books each, and sixth graders that they had borrowed 3-4 books each. Not sure how accurate these numbers are. Among the villagers, about 40 books had been borrowed, which is of course very little. In total, the library has around 530 titles.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Specific suggestions for the library in Site 1</strong></span></p><p><strong>For the school children</strong></p><ul><li>More books - all the teachers, students, and villagers mentioned this. I am guessing that this would be especially relevant to the children&#8217;s books, since if every student borrowed one book, that would remove half of the library books from the shelves. If only part of the collection is appropriate for children, and some books are more popular than others, it seems like this would often lead to popular books being unavailable. I would have to study the current collections much more in-depth to ascertain what kind of adult books should be added, although there seems to be a great interest among the teachers for teaching/pedagogics related books, which might be a great place to start. The suggestion about books like dictionaries and encyclopaedias would only be useful if the library was able to be kept open regularly for students to access books.</li><li>Although there is a lot of resistance from teachers to keeping the library open to students, this idea should still not be completely abandoned. Being able to access the library would both promote reading interest (it is much easier to get enticed by a physical book, than a printed out list), but also be a pre-requisite for actively using the library as part of the teaching and learning. The current location is clearly very small, and I am not sure if a larger location can be found. An alternative would be to only let in a certain number of students at a time. Alternatively to take out a number of books at a time to show to a class - either for reading in class, or for borrowing. For example, it is likely that also the younger students would be interested in picture books etc, but might not be able to choose from a list. If a teacher went into the library and picked out a number of simple books with big pictures etc, and brought these to the class and let the students spend an hour doing silent reading, I think even first graders and kindergarten students would be able to benefit from this. Many of the things I will write about improving the experience with the open library at Site 2 would be relevant to a possible future open library at Site 1 as well.</li><li>All the students mentioned that they would love to read magazines, and that they had no access to them currently. I wonder if either the library could subscribe to some youth magazines (perhaps we could be sponsored by the magazines?) if the library is open (this applies to Site 2 as well), or if the library is closed, if each class (nianji) could subscribe to one age-relevant magazine that could stay in the classroom to be read by students between classes, etc. (The old issues could then be cut up and provide material for posters and projects etc).</li></ul><p><strong>Reaching the villagers better</strong></p><ul><li>In general, lending to the villagers is still at a very early stage, and this is clearly the area that needs the most thought in Site 1. In a way, what RCEF is doing here is moving from trying to improve primary education - a very narrow and well-defined topic - to the much tricker task of &#8220;village development&#8221;. In order to do this well, one would have to understand the social relations in the village to a much deeper extent than what I was able to during my short stay. However I have a number of suggestions.</li><li>The library might be promoted during communication to the parents from the school, and especially during parent-teacher meetings (jiazhanghui).</li><li>It seems like it might absolutely be worth experimenting with adding some DVDs/VCDs to the collection, given that almost all villagers have access to DVD player and a television. Many of them are very interested in learning more about farming, taking care of their families etc, but might not be comfortable enough reading long books. There are different considerations here - would the availability of DVDs and VCDs entice more villagers to use the library at all - and thus perhaps in the future also borrow more books? Is it an important priority for RCEF to improve the reading skills also of older villagers, and in this case, would DVDs or VCDs hinder this? Some DVDs might also be used by the teachers, but so far, the big television is hidden in the teacher&#8217;s lounge and does not seem to get almost any use.</li><li>Currently the villagers are charged a deposit equivalent roughly to the cost of each book. Although the reading committee insisted that this was never a problem for villagers, I still have my doubts, since everything that makes borrowing more difficult will reduce the amount of borrowings. I wonder if the deposit is really necessary, and if it is, perhaps it would be possible to set a fixed, low amount, for example 5 or 10 yuan, rather than a varying and uneven amount (like 24,50).</li></ul><p>I think availability of the books is a huge problem - currently the books are only available either through the reading committee, which shows a list of titles and then fetch the book that is needed, or through villagers directly finding te young teacher at the school, here are some suggestions to either improve these methods, or add new methods:</p><ul><li>It seems like the reading committee, although very committed, only reach a specific subset of the population. This subset is certainly limited by age (quite old) and gender (male), and possibly only to their friends (I don&#8217;t understand the social relationships well enough to tell). A possibility would be to either extend the reading committee, or to create separate committees. One possible venue to reach women would be the informal dance groups that exist - perhaps we could work with them to not only distribute books (through the book list), but ideally also form reading groups that meet and discuss the books they read, etc. Even though literacy might be lower among women, I believe that some books, like recipes, books on child health etc, would still find a ready audience - and perhaps starting from this, they could work themselves up to novels, etc. I was wondering if we could also work through some of the female teachers at the primary school, although they are all quite young, and I am not sure how well connected they are.</li><li>Another group is the younger people. I was wondering whether we could for example induce the university students to take a leading role here - possibly against some kind of symbolic reward or &#8220;honor&#8221;, however I am not sure how much time they spend in the village (but even if they are just there during the summer months, this option would still be worth exploring). The same applies to the high school students. I don&#8217;t know how many young men and women live in the village, or if they have mostly left to find work, but they would also constitute and important group.</li><li>Although the teachers are strongly opposed to opening the library for children, I would propose that the library be opened for access by the villagers during for example one or several nights each week. There are unlikely to be many of them coming at once, and so the small space available would not be a large problem. The only thing needed would be someone volunteering to keep it open, and record borrowings, which if rotated among the reading committee should not be an insurmountable burden. This would enable villagers to directly browse for books, and immediately check out interesting material.</li><li>One of the members of the village committee suggested that they bring some of the books with them around in the village to show to the villagers. This is not a bad idea, and to take that a bit further, one thing that would probably increase the access of the library enormously is some kind of a library-bicycle. I am thinking of a three-wheel bicycle with a luggage rack, of the kind that already exists in the village, with the capacity to carry 50-hundreds of books in display format. In this way, a good selection of the library&#8217;s adult material could be put on the bike, and taken around to the different locations in the village where people congegrate, for example in the machine-part market, or outside some of the shops. Villagers would be able to immediately borrow the books they liked (or return books they had finished). It&#8217;s quite possible that the necessary material already exists in the village, and the investment would be minimal - what is needed is someone who is enthusiastic about taking on the role as an ambulant librarian. This method is frequently used in Indonesia.</li><li>In Indonesia, much of the idea behind people&#8217;s libraries (reading gardens, as they are called) is to make it as informal, and easy to access as possible. Usually the libraries are housed in someone&#8217;s house, or, when it expands, in a small structure in someone&#8217;s backyard, etc. This idea might not fit at all with a Chinese village, but I still wanted to mention it: What about housing the adult part of the library collection (minus the books on pedagogy and teaching) in for example the head of the village&#8217;s house? He or his wife seemed to almost always be around, and many of the other villagers seemed very comfortable about dropping in, leafing through the reading material that his house is already full of, etc. I didn&#8217;t discuss this with him, so I don&#8217;t know even if he would be willing to do this, and there might be all kinds of problems that I cannot foresee - whether other villagers would be &#8220;jealous&#8221;, or whether only his friends would use it, and not those who didn&#8217;t like him, etc. But unless the library in the school radically expands access to villagers, the primary way for villagers to access books would still be through the reading committee - whether through the list of titles, or in a possible future, through an ambulatory book-bicycle etc. In these cases, the storage location might be arbitrary, but storing it with the head of the village, or someone else in the reading committee, would make it much easier to access for them. Certainly, it would not be hard to find space for the 200+ books in question.</li></ul><p>As far as I understand, the different middle schools (chuzhong) near the primary school do not have their own libraries. As seen above, a few middle school students who know about the library come directly to look for the young teacher, and borrow books. Perhaps in the future, this could be expanded, either by giving them a list of book titles, having them order the books they want, and then having a teacher, or student volunteers etc, fetch the books from the primary school library. Or, by using the &#8220;library-bicycle&#8221; to provide access to library books on a/some set day(s) a week. In both cases, this would probably be contingent on adding more books to the library, and RCEF would have to decide whether it would be a better idea to contribute to libraries directly in the middle schools themselves, and whether they should keep their focus on the primary school. It is natural (and realistic) to believe that primary school students who have had positive experiences with borrowing books during their years at the primary school will be looking for access to more books when they reach middle school, and it would be sad if they did not have access. In fact, a generalized service with an ambulatory library bicycle in the village, would also potentially reach the middle school and high school students who reside there, so it doesn&#8217;t have to happen through the schools.</p><p>I will provide ideas for integrating the library into teaching and learning, and how to manage an open library, after a description of the situation at Site 2. Most of this is or can be relevant to Site 1 as well.<br /><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong></strong></span></p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong><br />Report from Site 2</strong></span></p><p><strong>Brief introduction</strong><br />As I stated above, I will not describe the village and the school in as much detail as above, because there are people in RCEF who understand this much better than me. Suffice to say that the village itself is a lot smaller than Site 1, and is also quite a bit further removed from the closest township (still in bicycling range). There is also no regular public transport to this village. The primary school was originally a publicly run school, that was closed down because of low student numbers, and taken over by a local couple who have turned it into a non-profit (minban) dormitory primary school. Many of the kids, who stay at the school for 12 days, and then go home for two days, are the children of migrant workers, and stay with their grandparents.</p><p>Because the school is not run by the government, it has a bit more wiggle-room in experimenting, but they are still tied to a lot of regulations, and it would be more correct to call it a Chinese primary school that is committed to excellence, teacher development, and a slightly more rounded view of development, rather than a full-blown experimental school with an alternative pedagogics. The classes I attended at Site 2 were very similar to the ones I attended in Site 1, but the teachers were often trying to push the envelope a little bit, and involve the students more. In addition, because it is a dormitory school, there is a much larger space for activities outside of class that can contribute to the children&#8217;s development. A great example is the fields behind the school, where different grades grow vegetables, and where the kids run enthusiastically every day",Many small improvements make a harmonious society (和谐社会)?,"china,development,libraries,personal,travel,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/06/02/many-small-improvements-make-a-harmonious-society-%e5%92%8c%e8%b0%90%e7%a4%be%e4%bc%9a/,"<p>It was great being back in Hangzhou, where I spent half a year in 2004. Already, Hangzhou was known as one of the most beautiful cities in China, and the local citizens were very proud of it. Coming back this time, my friend told me of many small changes that in different ways improved the citizens&#8217; lives. The library, which was already a great resource the last time I was here, abolished their 30 yuan/year fee for obtaining a library card, and also allows you to enter the library with your backpack, which was not allowed earlier.</p><p>They have started a system of free city bicycles - similar to what they do in for example Paris. It&#8217;s not as smooth as it could be yet, borrowing a bike requires an ID card, and a 300 yuan deposit, and the worst part is that the bicycle has to be returned to the place where it was borrowed. However, there are stations all around the West Lake area, and some others in the city core, and the first hour of borrowing is free. If you want to borrow it for longer, it&#8217;s only about 1 or 2 yuan per hour. Although this is a relatively new program, I saw many people enjoying a bike ride on a sunny Saturday around the lake.</p><p>I would love to know more about the development of health insurance programs in China, but my friend told me that all children in Hangzhou are automatically covered, and most adults with proper jobs receive coverage through their companies (my friend is self-employed, and pays about 100 yuan per month). This health insurance does not cover all costs, but it provides a &#8220;ceiling&#8221; for annual health expenditure at 1500 yuan, after which health care becomes free. This is incredibly important, because the newspapers are full of stories about families that go bankrupt and end up in destitution, because on of the family members fall seriously or chronically ill.</p><p>I also read in the newspaper that there were now projects to extend the health insurance that farmers in Sichuan receive for a very low price, to hospitals out of the province. Many farmers from Sichuan go to Beijing or Shanghai to work, and if they fall sick there (or have an accident), they often cannot afford to get treated in Beijing, and have to take the train back to Sichuan to get treated. Now, at least two hospitals in Beijing have signed an agreement with Sichuan province, and will honor Sichuan health insurance. Clearly, health insurance is at an early stage in China, but I still think all these different moves are incredibly valuable to citizens.</p><p>Primary schools in China have long been supposed to be free, but this has not been the case in practice, with schools charging all kinds of extra fees, and depending on these to stay open - thus excluding many children, whose parents cannot pay, especially in rural areas. From last year, it seems that the policy of free primary schooling, followed by increased transfers from the government, has finally been carried out, and all the schools I talked to in rural China said, with considerable pride, that the school now was completely free (including textbooks, but excluding 10-20 RMB per year for note books), and that enrollment was virtually hundred percent.</p><p>There are lots of problems in China, and innumerable challenges. Certainly I would like to see more freedom of speech, less blocking of the internet, and many other things. But as I write this, sitting on a modern and clean train that does Hangzhou to Shanghai in 160 km/h, and I think about what I mentioned above, and also what I wrote earlier about the greening of China - I also see a huge amount of positive developments, large and small. And I see many &#8220;democratic&#8221; governments in the world that are doing a lot less to benefit all their citizens. I can completely understand why the West&#8217;s complete lack of understanding or appreciation of this, can frustrate and anger Chinese who are tired of being scolded and belittled. Let us keep criticizing the bad things, but let us also celebrate the good things.</p><p>Stian<br />PS: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonious_society"">Harmonious society</a> (和谐社会) is a term introduced by Hu Jintao to denote that Chinese development will focus more on the social development of all citizens, and not just blindly on GDP.</p>",Can one-party systems be more accountable than democracies?,"asia,china,development,economics,India,politics,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/06/27/can-one-party-systems-be-more-accountable-than-democracies/,"<p><strong>Caveat</strong><br />I have spent over one and a half year of my life living in China, and a significantly larger part visiting it, learning the language, watching movies and soap-operas, reading blogs, discussing it with Chinese and non-Chinese, and in general thinking about it. There is still so much I don&#8217;t know or understand, but it is probably the non-Western country that I understand the best. And so it is natural for me to compare my experiences in other countries to my experiences in China. I did this to a certain extent in Indonesia (although realized thatI should never say this aloud, since people there have a bit of an inferiority complex about China, due to their own very complex past with Chinese ethnic minorities). However it seems the obvious thing to do in India, since the whole world is talking about the two rising giants, India and China.</p><p>Note however, that ifI am beginning to get an inkling of understanding of China, I am a complete and utter neophyte on India, having spent only a few weeks here, and being continually baffled by almost everything. I have also seen almost nothing of the country so far, and a half-assed knowledge of Hindi, and more Bollywood movies than I can count, scarcely qualifies me to say anything at all. Yet you cannot shut down your brain, and with all the caveats possible I will try to &#8220;think aloud&#8221; and see if putting my thoughts down on the screen will make them any clearer.</p><p><strong>Inequal development<br /></strong>Trying to quantify a country&#8217;s level of development is very treacherous stuff. I have travelled all over China and seen both luxury hotels in Shanghai, and rural schools in Shanxi, bicycling through tiny villages in Xinjiang, and taking buses through southern Yunnan on horrible roads. But how many percentage live in nice flats, and how many sleep on the streets? And how do you weigh certain factors up against others? For India, I have seen only a tiny part of the country so far, although I have read and heard a lot.</p><p>It still seems quite clear to me that the difference in development between China and India, today in 2008, is stark. This is especially relevant in all sectors pertaining to government. The train system, the level of roads and other public transportation, the quality of government schools, environmental controls, etc. There is no doubt that there are many problems in China, and I am sure that there are often reasons to criticize the government. Yet there is also a sense that it is continually and relentlessly working to improve the conditions of the entire country. The poorest rural schools are not in great shape, but teachers mostly show up, and so do students- literacy levels are very high.</p><p>Roads are quite well maintained, train stations are paragons of order (although this would not necessarily be felt by a random foreign visitor), and cities are well-ordered and orderly developed. There are large urban libraries in bigger cities, as well as cultural centers and museums. In general, althoug there is no doubt that corruption happens frequently in China, it still seems to happen a lot less frequently than in India, where many NGO workers have claimed to me that 80% of all government funds disappear between the central government, and the local level.</p><p>So during my weeks in India, both personally experiencing the level of urban and rural neglect (living in one of the poorest states of India, and also recently returning from a visit to a rural site, taking 7,5 quite uncomfortable hours to complete 145 kilometers of distance), I kept struggling with the concept that India being a democracy, with a very vocal press and a large number of independent NGOs, seemed to have a government that was much less efficient, and accountable, than that of China- where freedom of press is curtailed, organizational freedom is very low, and obviously voting the party out of power is impossible.</p><p><strong>A tentative solution<br /></strong>Turning this over in my mind (I had plenty of time on my before-mentioned trip), I came up with atentative explanation for why the Chinese one-party rule would actually be more likely to be accountable, than the Indian system. Let me try to explain.</p><p>Just like we learn in economics that althoughmonopolies can charge more than companies in acompetitive situation,theycan in fact not charge any price they like (or rather - they can, but would not make any money), in the same way one-party systems that wish to remain in power long-term can not drive through any politics they like. China has no tradition of democracy, and Confucianism would seem at first to support very authoritarian rulers, but there is a provision that this is because God&#8217;s will is projected through the ruler. If God should cease to view a certain emperor favorably, which would result in widespread economic and social problems in his society, it would be the duty of the citizens to overthrow the ruler.</p><p>In this vein, the Chinese government made a kind of social contract with the Chinese people in the 1980&#8217;s. They would radically reduce political supervision (total control through work units, people spying on you, etc) to increase economic growth. Their bargain was that they would bring continual growth in welfare and prosperity for all of China, as well as the global ascent of China as a nation (the communists certainly did not invent Chinese nationalism, although they skilfully played to it), and in exchange, the citizens would not bother about politics.</p><p><strong>So far, so good: Total responsability<br /></strong>So far, this bargain has worked wonders. Chinese growth has been in the two figures for years, and although it is certainly a much more inequal society than it was 20 years ago, the growth has to large extents benefitted the whole country, and more importantly: most people see opportunities and possibilities, rather than being locked into a situation where only others may prosper.</p><p>Certainly overthrowing a government as powerful as the Chinese is a much more difficult task than replacing a leader in India, thus on the outset one would think that the accountability in India would lead to better governance. However, in India there are many parties, as well as local, state and national governments. It is very hard for the common man to place blame on any level, as they continually blame each other, or blame the last party in power. In addition, I am guessing that many voters are voting mostly out of clientelism (we give you rice/loan-waivers just before election), or ideology (the BJP will create the great Hindu nation), rather than rationally for those who promote their long-term interests.</p><p>China is different - because there is only one party, for the last fifty years, on all levels. They have total control - and this leads to total responsibility. If the economy should start to falter in China, they can certainly try to blame all kinds of external and international forces like high oil prices, but within China, there is only one force - the Communist Party. They made a bargain, the people have done their part, and they will darn sure make sure the Communist Party does its part.</p><p><strong>Planning for the long-term<br /></strong>When I was travelling through Kazakhstan I saw posters everywhere with the number 2030. It later turned out that Kazakhstan&#8217;s strong president had an economic 30 year vision for how to turn his country into an &#8220;Asian Snow Leopard&#8221; (not content to be an Asian tiger, clearly). At the time, I though tthat it was a bit scary with a &#8220;democratic&#8221; politician with a 30 year plan, it didn&#8217;t seem like he was planning to go somewhere.</p><p>On the other hand, there are good things to be said for long-term planning as well. The Chinese Communist Party clearly plans to be around during the next 10-20 or even 50 years, and since there is no election tomorrow, they are able to make long-term strategic plans that will enable the country to continue its steady growth. There are no four year terms that cause silly actions like the recent Indian loan-waiver for farmers (which penalized those who had actually paid back their loans, and destroyed all loan-repaying discipline for the future) and they can concentrate on things that will strengthen the rural sectors in the long term, building infrastructure, increasing educational investment, shoring up resources globally, etc.</p><p><strong>They lucked out and got some nice non-democratic leaders<br /></strong><a href=""http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog"">Ethan Zuckerman</a>(can&#8217;t find the direct link), when writing about Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, has written that ideally you&#8217;d want a dictator that is planning to stay around for a while, because he is not likely to run the society completely to the ground, since he&#8217;d like to have something to extract resources from even in the future. Although China has gone through incredible upheavals and hardships during the first 30-40 years of the Communist Party, one could say that they have been rather lucky during the last 20 years, and this is likely to continue. Because the leaders of China are not out for personal enrichment at all (if they were, they would rather have started internet companies). Certainly some mid-level caders skim off transfers and sustain mistresses in Hong Kong and nice houses, but I believe strongly that the motivations of the top caders are all to make China stronger and better for all that live there. They are patriots who want to see the rise (or the return to their proper place) of China, after their 150 year of humiliation.</p><p>One might surely not agree with all their actions, one would hope for a much more open internet, more freedom of speech and assembly, etc. But on the whole, they are pushing China forwards, and they are taking full responsibility for their actions - in the long term. And honestly, if I had the choice between that, and hundreds of random politicians, mostly with a criminal background, killing their opponents, squabbling in parliament, busing in peasants to demonstrate in their favor, and caring only about power and privilege and not at all about the progress of the nation, and taking no responsibility for the outcomes of their actions&#8230; I might have to go with the current leadership. And that&#8217;s no easy choice for someone who is at heart an absolute democrate.</p><p>I might be giving India a hard rap here, and I am excited to be exploring this fascinating country more and learning more about it. However, this writing is more about China than about India, and for me it&#8217;s interesting because I believe I did come up with two reasons -total responsability and long-term perspective - why a one-party system in a relatively open state, that is committed to the long-term growth of the country can be more accountable and produce better governance than a (dysfunctional) democracy. Doesn&#8217;t mean it will always happen.</p><p>Comments welcome.</p><p>Stian</p>","Hehe => It seems you have spent so much time in China...and you are on the way of understanding us.

Although the title is a bit misleading, since it&#8217;s more of a conventional guidebook than anything very &#8220;unknown&#8221; (at least by residents), I still enjoyed reading about and seeing pictures of a city that I spent so much time in. This time, I left it on the 24th of May, and will be back in early September for probably at least two more years.</p><p>In the evening, I went to the local mall (not very fancy, and characterized by older women standing in front of automatic escalators trying to summon up courage to step on) to watch a movie. I did not know anything about the movie I had chosen, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kismet_Connection"">Kismat Konnection</a>, but was tipped off during the opening credits, where several institutions in Toronto and Ontario were thanked. Was part of this movie taking part in Toronto? I was already excited.</p><p>I didn&#8217;t have to wait long, Shahrukh Khan&#8217;s voice-over in the beginning of the movie began &#8220;I live in Toronto, in 427 Adelaide Street&#8221; (not sure about the number). Imagine my delight - the movie was not only set in Toronto, it was unabashedly, proudly, advertising the fact.</p><p>A bit of background information: Toronto is the third most active cinema production site in North America, and lots of US blockbusters have been produced there, but almost always camouflaging it as another city (as for example recently &#8220;Good Morning, Baltimore&#8221;). Local film production in Canada, except for French films (which barely get a showing in Angloland), is almost non-existant, and the very few films I did see from Toronto, made by Canadian producers, also did not &#8220;advertise their location&#8221;, but were mostly shot in-doors, with close-up shots etc, and could have been made anywhere.</p><p>The thing is that I love cities, and I love fiction - movies and novels - that are geographically &#8220;anchored&#8221;. Perhaps this is partly because I move around so much, and when I arrive in a new city, to make it my home for some years, I try to understand that city. Walking the lengths and breadth of it, learning the local language (not necessary in the case of Toronto, although Chinese helps), reading the local newspaper are all parts of this - as is reading novels and watching movies set in that city.</p><p>Perhaps coming from a small city, in a country with only five million inhabitants, also plays a role. I believe that its important for people to see their lives and surroundings reflected in fiction, and never understood why every movie in the universe had to be set in LA or New York (when I did a &#8220;tour of stars&#8217; homes&#8221; in LA, this was driven home to me - they pointed out not only houses where stars live, but also the many different films and serials the houses had featured in - these producers are too lazy to even venture out of their own neighbourhood). I love showing the Norwegian film Buddy to my friends in different countries, and point out all the different locations in Oslo that I recognize - this is close to my home, this is close to where I worked, I used to take this streetcar to work every day, etc.</p><p>I think Toronto is a unique city. God knows I complain about it enough, and there are many things I&#8217;d like to change, but all in all it&#8217;s a place I&#8217;ve grown very fond of. I&#8217;ve been dying to watch good movies that are explicitly set in Toronto, about Toronto, and come up very short. What&#8217;s worse, my Torontonian friends are quite confused by my complaints, and wonder why anyone would want to watch films set in Toronto. I want terrorists taking over city hall, bike chases in Scarborough, romance on the islands, brave teachers in Minnesauga, wise Indian shopkeepers dispensing wisdom on Gerrard, college pranks at St. George&#8230; Until now, my list didn&#8217;t feature &#8220;Bollywood singing and dancing on the Harbourfront&#8221;, but that is what I got.</p><p>As I mentioned, I was prepared to be combing through the film, observantly catching small glimpses of a streetscape that I knew. Instead I was treated to great vistas from the Broadview bridge, and Toronto skyline by night. The office of the property developers is clearly in 200 King St, and the film is about saving the Harbourfront Community Center from demolition. The final scene even takes place inside the Toronto city hall. They jaywalk on College, and go partying near Yonge and Dundas, take the streetcar, and even skirt traffic under the highway near the lake.</p><p>A great movie, not just because of Toronto. Last week I watched Mehbooba, which represented the worst of Bollywood - all singing and dancing in exotic landscapes (Budapest and New York), a huge elaborate wedding, great emotions, for no reason at all, with no character development, no plot, and no meaning. It&#8217;s the kind of movie that if someone watches it as their first Bollywood movie, all their prejudices would be reaffirmed, and they&#8217;d never watch another. Kismat Konnection on the other hand, is still no deep work of art, but it&#8217;s a funny and likeable movie that just happens to be set in a great city :).</p><p>I wonder if this movie would be able to get showings in mainstream cinemas in Toronto, or writeups in newspapers. I have many times complained about how parochial mainstream cinemas are, showing all Hollywood on their 15+ screens, even when surrounded by large percentages of Chinese, South-Indians, Latinos etc. Or the fact that NOW Magazine (which I love) still wastes pages on every mediocre Hollywood movie that comes out, but doesn&#8217;t even mention Taare Zameen Par, one of the best movies of the year, even though it runs on at least three screens in Toronto, and is subtitled and fully accessible to all.</p><p>Enough about that though, run and watch the movie. And let&#8217;s rejoice about the fact that at least someone thinks Toronto is photogenic enough to not have to be hidden away.</p><p>Stian</p>",Celebrating first book read in a foreign language,"books,India,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/07/19/celebrating-first-book-read-in-a-foreign-language/,"There are many different milestones when learning a new language. They are important to measure ones progress, especially important since often I am learning independently, and don&rsquo;t have the crutch of thinking - if I passed the test successfully, then my studies must be on track. But equally or more importantly, they provide a great sense of satisfaction and encouragement which is crucial, because learning new languages takes a long time, and often one can &ldquo;plateu&rdquo; and have the feeling of no progress for a long period of time. Then, when milestones or breakthroughs occur, it makes it all seem worth it.When asked how many languages I know, I am often tempted to ask &ldquo;How well does one have to know a language, for it to count?&rdquo;. Indeed I ask myself that question often. To me, there are a number of &ldquo;indicators&rdquo; or goals. Partly, they also represent different sub-skills, and as such, your listening might be better in one language, and your speaking in another, depending both on the language, and on the setting in which I learnt it.Having a conversation in a language that goes relatively smoothly, being able to watch a movie in the language without subtitles, understanding a news broadcast on TV, getting through a newspaper, being able to listen to an audiobook, are all great goals. But perhaps the one main goal in learning a new language, is <em>getting through my first book</em>. Since I am just about to finish my first book in Hindi, I was thinking last night about the &ldquo;first books&rdquo; in different languages that I have learnt. Surprisingly I remember both which book, and when, for most of the languages. So here is a short list.<img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/08/b7/1f1d228348a0795a5eb1f010._AA280_.L.jpg"" alt="""" width=""280"" height=""280"" /><strong>Norwegian (and Nordic)</strong> - Norwegian is my mother tongue and as such its impossible to say which was my first proper &ldquo;book&rdquo;, since I was learning from age 5. Even in Swedish and Danish I cannot tell for sure, although it is possible that my first book read in Danish was <em>The Woman and the Ape</em> (Kvinden og aben), by Peter Heg. Till this day, I love reading in Norwegian, and many of my favorite authors are Norwegian. I also read lots in Swedish, and enjoy audiobooks from both languages. Danish is much rarer, but I would like to read more.<strong>English</strong> - <em>Little Lord Fauntleroy</em>, in 7th grade. I remember that the direct speech was quite difficult, perhaps because it was written in a dialect or sociolect. I remember getting a collection of Robert Ludlum books for Christmas during jr. high, and becoming very impressed by the advanced narrative techniques, which also influenced my own school writing (in Norway we predominantly do creative writing until high school). So far, I have probably read more in English than I ever read in Norwegian.<strong>German</strong> - Not quite sure if this was the first, but I remember reading <em>The Last Juror</em> by John Grisham on a ferry in Europe, doing Europe by car with the family, the summer I turned 16. Although I read German quite fluently, I have not found that many others that I really enjoyed, but Herman Hesse remains one of my favorites - especially <em>Siddharta</em>, which I read while hitchhiking in Austria during my last year of high school.<img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://miresperanto.narod.ru/biblioteko/margarita/margarita.JPG"" alt="""" width=""182"" height=""248"" /><strong>Italian</strong> - My first book was a non-fiction manual on how to teach English to Italians, of all things, checked out from Monfalcone library, where I often went. That was where I first noticed the problem of getting sleepy while reading a foreign language. I would enter, completely rested, and after just 20 minutes of reading a book in Italian, my eyelids would weigh a ton. I later found a lot of Italian authors that I really liked, like Italo Calvino, Primo Levi, Nathalie Ginzburg, and primo inter pares, Andrea De Carlo.<strong>Esperanto</strong> - Not sure if this came before or after Italian, but during my first year in high school I read a manual on teaching Esperanto using la zagreba metodo. After this, I have read much in Esperanto, but not many full books. I remember enjoying<em> La majstro kaj Margarita</em> (by Russian writer Bulgakov), as well as a biography of Zamenhof by Marjorie Boulton.<strong>Chinese</strong> - One of the most amazing milestones in learning a language is when you are slowly making your way through your first book, forcing yourself to read ten pages before going to bed, and then suddenly one night, when you have reached the allotted ten pages, thinking &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just read one more page, I want to see what will happen&rdquo;! I remember this happening with my first Chinese novel, 俗不可耐 (su bu ke nai), about expats and Chinese overseas returnees in Beijing. After this, I&rsquo;ve read a number of novels in Chinese, but sad to say, to this day my reading speed is not high enough to be able to really &ldquo;get into it&rdquo;.<img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://www.chineseculture.net/sbkn.jpg"" alt="""" width=""187"" height=""267"" /><strong>Russian</strong> - I don&rsquo;t speak Russian, but I travelled through Russian-speaking countries several times, and finally spent a month in Russia at the Russiskiy Universitet Druzhbi Narodov (Russian People&rsquo;s Friendship University) with an absolutely lovely old Russian lady as a teacher. During that time, I found a bilingual version (facing pages) of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, and read through it all. I love bilingual books, and hunted through all of Moscow for more, even had my friend call the publisher, to no avail. This doesn&rsquo;t quite count, as I could not make my way through a Russian novel &ldquo;unassisted&rdquo;. At my best, I could kind of make out the meaning of a newspaper article, but that is almost all forgotten now. I still hope to go back and learn Russian properly - once I find a nice Russian city with good vegetarian food.<strong>Spanish</strong> - Weirdly, my first book in Spanish might have been the same as the first I read in German. For the German, I am not sure, but for the Spanish, it certainly was <em>The Last Juror</em>, which happened to be lying around in my friend&rsquo;s room, during Christmas 2004, half a year before I would go to Mexico to begin studying Spanish. Since then, I have read a number of novels in Spanish, and especially enjoy Isabel Allende.<img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://figurpublik.com/cetak/apresiasi/images/ronggeng_1.jpg"" alt="""" /><strong>Indonesian</strong> - After hearing everyone in China ask me if Norway has &ldquo;beautiful forests&rdquo;, because they had heard about this book, what would be more natural than me reading the Japanese &ldquo;<em>Norwegian Wood</em>&rdquo; by Murakami, in Indonesian translation, in Jakarta? I bought it on the day before my 25th birthday, on the same day as I saw the first Indonesian film that I could follow without subtitles (the great Mendadak Dangdut). I went on to enjoy a lot of Indonesian literature, the best and most profound reading experience (and most difficult) was perhaps <em>Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk</em>, by Ahmad Tohari (whose <em>Orang-orang proyek</em> is also great). I am still planning to re-read the amazing Pramoedya Ananta Toer&rsquo;s Buru Quartet in Indonesian.<img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N55V47J1L._SL500_AA240_.jpg"" alt="""" width=""183"" height=""183"" /><strong>French</strong> - Not having ever studied the language, but helped by knowledge of Italian, Spanish and Esperanto, I read the <em>La Bicyclette Bleu</em> during my summer job as a museum guide in 2007. It was a part of a trilogy, and luckily my local library had all three, so I ended up reading 1200 pages of French that summer. I hope to read more, or perhaps even learn the language properly, in the future.<img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/hi/thumb/b/b9/HPGOFHINDI.jpg/152px-HPGOFHINDI.jpg"" alt="""" width=""152"" height=""232"" /><strong>Hindi</strong> - Although I started reading <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em> in parallell (the library where I volunteer has the Hindi version, and I bought the English version), and reached 170 pages, that was not to be my first book in Hindi due to the length. On my birthday, Mamta the librarian took me to a Hindi bookstore, and had me pick out some books as a birthday gift. I chose four abridged versions of European classics, and right now am almost finished with <em>80 Days Around the World</em>. It&rsquo;s still extremely slow going, and I get tired like nothing else, but it&rsquo;s a step on the way.I&rsquo;ve also begun books in Dutch and Portuguese, but not finished any so far.Do you remember what your first book in a foreign language was?Stian","Rafal => Thank you for your post. Now I can see that it is absolutely normal to learn a few languages simultaneously by simply using them. I have been interested in foreign languages for some twenty years, but I still do not know which language I know and which not. You have helped me understand that foreign languages, especially written, can be fascinating enough to not bother seeking clear-cut definitions of what knowing a foreign language might mean, particularly that so many people are nowadays so keen of skills classifications (AI, B2, C1, etc). . "Is your course schedule full yet? Some great offerings (Wiley wikis),,http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/07/20/is-your-course-schedule-full-yet-some-great-offerings-wiley-wikis/,"<p>When I took Wiley&#8217;s course <a href=""http://opencontent.org/wiki/index.php?title=Intro_Open_Ed_Syllabus "">Intro to Open Education</a>, it was something quite new for me, and I learnt as much from the design (both the things done well and the things that could be improved) as I learnt from the contents. Turns out his course has inspired a following, who have kept learning both from his example, and from each other, experimenting with different ways of conducting classes online, often blending it with for-fee credit students.</p><p>I first came across Teemu&#8217;s course on <a href=""http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Composing_free_and_open_online_educational_resources"">Composing free and open educational resources</a>. This was conducted on Wikiversity, which was also interesting to me, because I had been considering Wikipedia a repository of course materials, rather than a site to conduct teaching and learning (which I would think would require different functonality, etc). I was excited to see this, and even wrote to Teemu asking that the lessons from conducting such a course be written up.</p><p>Otago Polytechnic has conducted the two courses <a href=""http://wikieducator.org/Designing_for_flexible_learning_practice"">Designing for flexible learning practice</a> and <a href=""http://wikieducator.org/Evaluation_of_eLearning_for_Best_Practice"">Evaluation of e-learning for best practices</a> on WikiEducator, and in about a week the new course <a href=""http://wikieducator.org/Facilitating_online_communities"">Facilitating online communities</a> run by Leigh Blackall will begin. This looks very interesting, and I am considering joining, even though it would be very difficult since I am spending the next six weeks in India and China. I might follow the course and the discussions, without being an active participant.</p><p>Finally, Stephen Downes and George Siemens are offering what is going to be a <a href=""http://ltc.umanitoba.ca:83/wiki/Connectivism"">&#8220;megacourse&#8221; on Connectivism and Connective Knowledge</a>. Although there is no detailed course plan available, they have attracted a lot of attention, and over 1000 people have already signed up to be informed when the course starts (of course, not all of those will participate actively). This means that the course will function quite differently from a smaller course with 30-50 participants where everyone - even though it takes a lot of time - can still read everyone else&#8217;s blog posts.</p><p>What is exciting is that there seems to be growing up a whole ecosystem of services and projects based around this course. Not only is it being translated into <a href=""http://pro.yeeyan.com/wiki/%E8%BF%9E%E6%8E%A5%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89%E8%AF%BE%E7%A8%8B"">Chinese</a>, <a href=""http://ltc.umanitoba.ca:83/wiki/Conectivismo"">Spanish</a> and <a href=""http://ltc.umanitoba.ca:83/wiki/Conectivismo_-_Curso_online"">Portuguese</a> (we&#8217;ll have to see how this will happen once the course actually starts, but it&#8217;s tremendously interesting to see someone even trying to facilitate such a course for multilingual audiences). They have a Google group that is active with discussions, and there are proposals for local learning communities, interactive chats, etc. I will be following this course very closely once it starts, perhaps participating actively, to see what new ways of interacting that develop.</p><p>In addition to the sheer amount of new courses that are explicitly orienting themselves in a &#8220;Wiley&#8221; tradition, and learning from each other, to the extent that Leigh Blackall coined the term &#8220;Wiley wikis&#8221;, there is also an emerging conversation taking place about what we can learn from these different attempts, how we should structure future courses - in terms of instructor load, participation of students, managing paying and non-paying students, trying to provide credit to external students through different institutional arrangements, etc.</p><p>Leigh Blackall, Teemu Leinonen and Bronwyn Hegarty conducted a conversation about this topic, which is available for <a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/WileyWikis"">download</a>.

There are several ways of assessing the size of a language Wikipedia, none perfect. The most common one is to look at the number of articles, and although this gives a benchmark figure, it can be very misleading. This is especially because of robots that run around creating thousands of new almost empty articles, for example of cities in the US with only census data. There is nothing wrong with this per se, but it can completely distort statistics, and it&rsquo;s also damaging when people single-mindedly focus on reaching some goal in terms of number of articles, without focusing on making them longer, and of higher quality.</p><p>Because of my long (<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/11/screencast-of-wikipedia-offline-zip-doc/"">although not very successful</a>) involvement with creating solutions for viewing Wikipedia offline, I have spent a lot of time looking at the packages that Wikipedia compiles for download. For the first time in over a year, they successfully completed a full dump of all languages, <a href=""http://static.wikipedia.org/downloads/2008-06"">available here</a>. These packages have one HTML file representing each article (as well as user pages, discussions, images etc), in an extremely (typically at least 10x) compressed form. Looking at this size in itself is unlikely to tell us anything useful (except for whether it can fit on for example a DVD), but comparing it either to previous dumps, or to other language Wikipedias, can give a good measure of relative size.</p><p>One problem is that they have made a slight change in the packaging procedure - whereas earlier all the files where simply packaged with 7Zip, currently they are first tarred and then the tar file is packaged with 7Zip. I have not done any experiments to see if this has any impact on package size - the reason for the change was to speed up making the dumps, but because of this, historical comparisons are not easily conducted.</p><p>However, for an upcoming (possible) talk in Delhi, I decided to look at the relative size of different Indic language Wikipedias. I remember being shocked, when starting to study Hindi, that the page about Norway in the Hindi Wikipedia was only two sentences long! (Sadly, about a year later, this is still the case. Hopefully my Hindi will soon be good enough to be able to add content). Certainly a lot of Indians, both in India and abroad, contribute to Wikipedia, but they choose to contribute to the English language version.</p><p>So below are all the languages spoken in India (I might have missed some, but I don&#8217;t think so), and the size in megabytes, of their compressed dump files. I also checked how their page about Norway looked in each language (facilitated by my <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2007/11/13/tools-and-hacks-wikipedia-redirect/"">redirect script</a>). Certainly the absence or presence of a good article about Norway is not a great measure of a good encyclopaedia, but most up-and-coming language versions try to get certain basic articles in place as early as possible, and these certainly include articles about all the countries in the world.</p><p>Kannada and Urdu was the only two that contained decent sized articles about Norway. Kannada is near the top in size, so this is not surprising, but Urdu is interesting. Can it be connected to the fact that Pakistanis are the biggest group of non-Western immigrants in Norway? This has not affected Norway&#8217;s treatment in the Panjabi version (most Pakistanis in Norway are from the Punjab region), perhaps because the Panjabi version is written in Gurmukhi, a script similar to Devanagari and used in India, and not in Shahmukhi, similar to the Urdu script?</p><p>That Telugu is the largest is not so surprising, given that a library researcher at the Banaras Hindu University told me that Telugu currently produces the most literature in India. However, their wiki had no page on Norway at all (most of the others have at least a place-holder page), and even when searching for broad topics like &#8220;Philosophy&#8221;, I found nothing. Perhaps they have written very good articles about a subset of topics?</p><p>It&#8217;s also curious that Bishnupriya Manipura, a language spoken in Manipur that I had not even heard of before, comes so high up - higher than Hindi. Perhaps there is some technical reason, or perhaps they are just a small community that are actively contributing articles. Certainly there are not many millions of Esperanto speakers in the world, but because of a small and very dedicated community, they manage to produce an encyclopaedia of an impressive size.</p><p>Here is the list, with a few other languages included for comparison.</p><p><strong>Size in MB of compressed files of language Wikipedias, as of June 2008</strong></p><p><em>English 14,000<br />German 3,200<br />Chinese 626<br />Norwegian 361</em><br /><em>Esperanto 185</em><br />Telugu 52<br />Kannada 46<br />Bangla 34<br />Tamil 34<br />Bishnupriya Manipura 30<br />Hindi 30<br />Malayalam 29<br />Marathi 23<br />Nepali 21<br />Urdu 16<br /><del datetime=""2008-08-01T06:31:42+00:00"">Kannada 10</del><br />Sanskrit 3.2<br />Gujarati 3.1<br />Sindhi 2.6<br />Bhojpuri 2<br />Tibetan 1.9<br />Panjabi 1.7<br />Kashmiri 1.3<br />Oriya 1.3</p><p>Hopefully, if I repeat this exercise in a year, I will be able to see a lot of progress&#8230; I have plans to promote editing Wikipedia in your own language for students at University of Toronto - who are from all over the world, and have access to very good infrastructure.

Linked from a number of blog posts, the <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.open.ac.uk/"">Open University of the UK</a>, long a pioneer in the field of open education in both meanings of the word, and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.cmu.edu/"">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, which has some extremely innovative <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.cmu.edu/oli/"">open learning modules</a>, are partnering to propose a <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://iet-public-wiki.open.ac.uk/index.php/OPLRN_proposal"">very ambitious research project</a> to &ldquo;<em>develop infrastructure, community and activity to help share research findings on the design and use of OERs&rdquo;.</em> It aims to &ldquo;<em>be a global network of OER producers and users as participatory researchers who share designs, methodologies and evidence for evaluating the effectiveness of OERs in increasing and equitably distributing knowledge.</em>&rdquo;I really liked one of their analogies, that of the cancer research portal: <em>&ldquo;<strong>Cancer Research portal.</strong> In more established fields such as cancer research (or we might take the Human Genome Project) there is a consensus map of the structure of the field, the major research questions, and the different sub-communities and associated methodologies. It is possible to place oneself on the map, and to coordinate effort in a well understood way. What is the OER research map? What is the OER design process? What does it mean to validate an OER? What are the central challenges that all agree on? The OPLRN seeks to create a structured &lsquo;place&rsquo; where questions such as these can be debated, and hopefully, enabling more effective coordination of action around issues and OERs of common interest.&rdquo;</em>I can identify with this because I have felt the same lack in the field of development and libraries. I wrote my BA thesis (I will post about it here very soon, when the translation is done) about community libraries in Indonesia, and throughout I struggled with orienting myself in a field that didn&rsquo;t really exist. What were the typologies of community libraries? Methodologies for investigating them? Theories about their function in different contexts? Lists of case studies already conducted, commonly shared variables, suggestions for criteria for success? I was trying to do a gap-analysis to see where my research could fit in - but indeed I could not even find the entire field of research.As I go into what will hopefully be a career of creating, advocating for, and researching ways of open learning and teaching, but also more specifically my MA research project, which will probably center on reuse and adaptation of Western educational resources by Chinese universities, such a resource will be invaluable. It will mean that not only will my own research be considerable strengthened, being able to draw upon all the studies that have already been conducted, use shared frames of understanding, and theories that others have found useful, but when it is finished, it will not just be another MA thesis in the library, but it will (ideally) make a small but significant contribution to a dynamic body of scholarship.The ideal is to &ldquo;<em>build an epistemic community &mdash; a reflective community of practice dedicated specifically to advancing understanding not only of its field, but of what can/should count as &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; in the field. Educational technology, and OERs specifically, are young, interdisciplinary design fields lacking widely adopted design methods, patterns, or evaluation criteria. The infrastructure must therefore foster appropriate forms of </em><em>discourse and memory: structures for sharing, indexing, recovering and debating the community&rsquo;s </em><em>collective intelligence on the relative merits of different OER design and evaluation approaches. Nor can the infrastructure fossilize as soon as the project&rsquo;s startup funding ends: it must be a </em><em>sustainable</em> <em>social and conceptual network that can evolve through the contributions of many people.</em>&rdquo;In addition to the research projects, they also plan to develop several tools to further the actual processes of academic discourse online.&ldquo;<em>An epistemic community is interested in claims and supporting evidence, but also in counter-claims and differing interpretations of the same evidence. While many projects are engaged in building collective intelligence, few know how to deal well with contested knowledge &mdash; other than by enabling comments, threaded fora, blogs and wikis.</em><em>[&hellip;] The software deliverable from this project will enable learners, educators, researchers, analysts and other decision makers to ask questions such as, </em><em>What evidence is there that this OER is effective?, but equally important, </em><em>Does the community agree with the claims made? What counter-examples are there? In addition, as a socio-technical infrastructure, it will be architected to support diverse forms of evidence, with an architecture of participation that sets a low threshold for contribution, and community structures to help those who want, to move from the periphery to become more active, central players</em>.&rdquo;I am also proud to see someone from <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/"">OISE</a> prominently involved; professor <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.ikit.org/people/scardamalia.html"">Marlene Scardamalia</a>.Looking forward to following their progress, wish the project the best of luck, and hope to perhaps get involved at some stage.Stian","Knowledge building: theory, pedagogy and technology | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] reviews that scientists produce, and this reminds me of the initial OLNet proposal, which I blogged about three years ago.

Run by Carnegie Mellon University, in collaboration with Chinese and Indian governments, they have already scanned some 1,5 million books. What is exciting is not just the sheer numbers, but the incredible linguistic variety. Over one million books available in Chinese, and thousands in Urdu, Hindi, Arabic, Telugu, Tamil and many others. They have book scanning centers around the world, and have apparently developed some very advanced new technology, both for book scanning, for OCR in different scripts, etc.</p><p><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://www.ulib.org/ULIBImages/ULIBsmall.gif"" alt="""" width=""99"" height=""65"" /><strong>Technical issues</strong><br />Given all this, I was extremely enthusiastic to try out the project. However, it turns out that all their files are either stores as DjVu (mostly the Chinese contributions) or tiff files (everything else). Both of these require special viewers to be installed, and after spending a lot of time trying to follow different instructions and downloading different files, I was finally able to display the Chinese books in Firefox on my MacBook, but I have still not been able to view the tiff files. And even if I am able to display the Chinese pages, the solution is still very far from as user-friendly and appealing as the OpenLibrary flip-book solution.</p><p>It does say on the Universal Library site that they will eventually also make their books available as PDFs etc, but my immediate thought would be, why don&#8217;t they publish it through the OpenLibrary? They already have the infrastructure and the technical solution. Indeed I don&#8217;t know the different reasons that lead to this not being an integrated part of the OpenContent Alliance in the first place, but if it was possible to integrate all these sources into the OpenLibrary - which is already aiming to be a truly international multilingual solution (even the interface can be translated in many languages) - I think that would be a wonderful solution. (Apparently Universal Library is also part of the Open Content Alliance which runs the Open Library).</p><p><strong>The amazement of diving into the collections</strong><br />Either way, I hope these technical issues are solved, because this is an incredibly revolutionary project. Already a million books are available in Chinese, both out of copyright and ones they have been able to negotiate rights for&#8230; I could spend days doing all kinds of weird searches, finding Chinese books written hundred and fifty years ago about Norwegian folk tales, the cultural system in China, or Esperanto. This is also providing me with a renewed motivation to learn classical Chinese (wenyan), because of course most of the books are written in both traditional characters and classical Chinese. And the availability of such a treasure trove of books in Hindi and Urdu, is a huge incentive to my current efforts to learn Hindi!</p><p><strong>Vital projects for humanity</strong><br />I think these efforts are some of the most important going on right now, and they deserve a lot more financial support than they are getting! I would love to see these scanning efforts also expanding to other countries and languages. And especially working hard to try to secure copyrights or permissions for even newer books. One of the only books on the history of libraries in Indonesia, &#8220;Perpustakaan Indonesia dari zaman ke zaman&#8221; from 1966 is obligatory reading for anyone wanting to do research on the history of libraries and literacy in Indonesia, but it is not available online, and in the US only in a few tattered copies that are sent back and forth between research libraries on inter-library loan (I got mine from a US institution on ILL). There is no way you can convince me that putting that online would constitute anything immoral!</p><p>What&#8217;s more, many of these collections are incredibly vulnerable and are disappearing - I have myself seen the results of high humidity and low maintenance budgets in Indian university libraries, with old books falling apart. Not to mention archives of millions of manuscripts written on palm leaves, etc. We cannot afford to loose this heritage!<br /><strong><br />Keep us up to date!</strong><br />One thing that I find lacking from both projects is a good project blog, that is kept up to date. As a big supporter, I would like to know how their work is going, what their current bottle-neck is, what they are working on. Not in annual reports, but in daily or weekly reports. Most of the &#8220;news&#8221; on the Universal Library site is not dated, and the statistics of scanned books are a year old. If people knew more about what was going on, they would be in a much better position to offer suport, both direct, and indirect.</p><p>Stian</p>","Heartburn Home Remedy => Not that I&#039;m impressed a lot, but this is   more than I expected   when I stumpled upon a link on SU telling that the info here is quite decent.

Luckily, my hotel has a TV (with some 80 channels), and thus I was able to catch the live broadcast of the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. I am usually not a huge olympics, or sports fan, but given my long connection to China, and how much I have been hearing about the olympics from my Chinese friends - ever since I was there first in 2001 - I was quite interested in how it would turn out.</p><p>In addition, watching it on Indian TV gave me an opportunity to listen to the Indian commentators and see how the olympics, and China, were perceived here. In fact, I kept switching back and forth between three different English language channels (all Indian) - one was CNN IBN, one was Time Now I think, and there was a third on, perhaps NDTV.</p><p><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3156/2746417883_b18751c8c7_m.jpg"" alt="""" width=""160"" height=""240"" /><strong>Prelude</strong></p><p>In the run up to the Olympics, much of the newspaper coverage has been focused on the fact that India&#8217;s contingent is quite small, and that India cannot be expected to win many medals. In fact, I think they have only won 16 golds in all the Olympics together. There was also a row about who would get to accompany the athletes, with some having their parents going with them, and others not even getting a space for their coach (reminded me a bit of the negotiations in Chak De).</p><p>One of those &#8220;can only happen in India&#8221; moments was when the <a href=""http://www.sinlung.com/?p=3460"">weightlifter Monika Devi was expelled for testing positive on a dope test</a>. Manipur is a province tucked away near Cambodia, with a people that looks more East-Asian than South-Asian, and they decided that this had all been some kind of conspiracy from &#8220;mainland India&#8221; to exclude Manipur from the Olympics. Subsequently a bandh - general strike - was declared for 24 hours in the entire province, effigies were burnt, demonstrations ensued in which at least five people were hurt, etc. In the end Monika was cleared to go, but this was too late to have her enter the competition (I suppose the fact that she was subsequently cleared only deepens the Manipuri belief in a grand conspiracy).</p><p>In general, Indians seem far too eager to block railway lines, call for general strikes, and burn effigies. Another example from the last few days was when <a href=""http://www.zeenews.com/articles.asp?aid=461197&amp;sid=REG"">Kannada groups blocked all the railway lines going to Tamil Nadu</a>. The reason was that Kannada and Telugu were about to be awarded &#8220;classical language&#8221; status by the Indian government (which would mean more support for language preservation and development). Apparently the Kannada groups believed that Tamil Nadu (which posits itself as home of the original classical Dravidian language) was trying to block this appointment, and thus shut down traffic. But back to the Olympics&#8230;</p><p><strong>Extremely positive</strong></p><p>Generally, the commentators were extremely positive to the opening ceremony. Especially one of the commentators, I think on Time Now, was a talking machine. He seemed to be trying to break some kind of record, as he gushed out superlatives, the mother of all ceremonies, amazing, spectacular, cannot believe my own eyes&#8230; All the channels also spent a lot of energy on the Indian team when they entered, re-running for 20 minutes the one minute footage of the ragtag team entering, and Sonia Gandhi waving to them. The focus, however, was quite different. Our exuberant commentator was over himself in appreciation, talking about how excited the Indian&#8217;s looked, the patriotism that formerly beamed out of their eyes, and the smile on Sonia Gandhi&#8217;s lips that had not been seen for so long.</p><p><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060317/s3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""259"" height=""323"" />The other channel, I believe CNN IBN, was however horrified by the fact that while the men had been wearing nice traditional Indian garb, only one of the women wore a sari, while the others wore training jackets and pants. In addition, about half the Indian team had digital cameras and were busy filming the audience while walking out, prompting some comments that they looked like a bunch of tourists (in all fairness, most of the other delegations did the same thing).</p><p>This &#8220;dress disaster&#8221; prompted much discussion, and in the newspaper it was later revealed that <a href=""http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEE20080809170621&amp;Page=E&amp;Title=Olympics+2008&amp;Topic=0"">the girls had come straight from practice and not had time to change</a> (one wonders if they hadn&#8217;t been told about the Opening Ceremony). However, evil tongues suggest that the saris were not delivered in time, or that the athletes were unhappy about the color and quality of the fabric. We shall never know.</p><p><strong>Could India do it?</strong></p><p>One of the topics raised frequently by all the commentators, who were awed by the organization and infrastructure in Beijing, was &#8220;could India host the Olympics?&#8221;. Many frankly said no, stating that India couldn&#8217;t put on a tenth of this Opening Ceremony, and discussing the infrastructure in Delhi as extremely poor. However, the country will host the Commonwealth Games in 2010, and this was seen as an important stepping stone. Apparently about 50 officials from India were in Beijing trying to learn from the organization of the games.</p><p>Stian</p><p>Thanks to<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kathy_zhuang/""> </a><small><small><strong><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kathy_zhuang/"">.. ✈Katherina ➳..</a> </strong>for the two first pictures.<strong><br /></strong></small></small></p>",Opensource Fellowships and localization into Indic languages at SARAI,"events,India,languages,opensource,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/08/10/opensource-fellowships-and-localization-into-indic-languages-at-sarai/,"<p><strong>Background</strong></p><p><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://www.sarai.net/logo.jpg"" alt="""" width=""276"" height=""50"" />I somehow came across the homepage of <a href=""http://www.sarai.net/"">Sarai</a> about two years ago, while living in Indonesia. I was extremely impressed with what I saw from their webpages and mailing lists - a vibrant community space/collective that was interested in many of the same things as me; urban issues in developing countries, open source, open culture, national and regional languages etc. They publish a ton of great writings, both in English and Hindi, mostly available from their website, and I downloaded several <a href=""http://www.sarai.net/publications/readers/"">Sarai Readers</a> and enjoyed reading their thoughts on urban development in Delhi, piracy culture, etc.</p><p><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://www.sarai.net/resolveUid/f1c64cafcf848794147dbf442fe7e0da"" alt="""" width=""80"" height=""99"" />I also subscribed to their newsletter, and every month I would get an email telling my about the films they were showing and the talks they were featuring, thinking it was such a pity that all this interesting stuff was going on in Delhi, and I was stuck in Toronto&#8230; So when I was finally going to India this summer, for the first time, I knew I wanted to fit in a visit to Delhi, and to Sarai.</p><p>On Friday, having spent two days in Delhi being exhausted from avoiding all the touts in Connaught Place, and walking around in the humidity, I suddenly received an invitation from Sarai to a seminar where all their Open Source Fellows would be presenting their projects. Sarai has been using some of their own money, and also some money from Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, to give fellowships for projects involving open source and localization into Indian languages to groups around India. I was extremely lucky to be able to attend this very interesting gathering, and I learnt a lot from the people there. Here are some of the projects that were presented.</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://lh6.ggpht.com/shaklev/SJ_7IM9-h5I/AAAAAAAACPM/sLsrMjttEf0/s288/100_0440.JPG"" alt="""" />Gora Mohanty introduced Sarai&#8217;s involvement in FLOSS. Originally the organization mainly focused on urban studies, but they needed tools to publish in Indian languages, and originally their involvement was more to &#8220;scratch an itch&#8221;. They currently have 40 open fellowships, and 10 specific FLOSS fellowships. Based on the experiences from this year, they will try to provide more support to the fellows, and also promote more interaction between the different fellows, in future years. A question related to this is what collaboration technology to be used, since for example IRC is very convenient for some, but scares others away. (At the end of day one, I suggested having all the fellows blog, and then aggregating all the blogs in a planet somewhere). One experience they have gained is that technical people are often not the best people to do localization work.</p><p>In general, the projects have had a very high success rate, partly explained by the fact that the people who receive the fellowships are often older and more established than for example the Google Summer of Code participants, and have a track record of delivering.</p><p>Lately it has become much easier to get funding for doing FLOSS projects in India, since the concept is becoming quite widely known, although perhaps not so well understood by funding agencies still. There is also more and more commercial activity in for example Hindi localization, and many of the projects Sarai fund are more on the &#8220;edges&#8221;, involving lesser spoken languages, etc.</p><p>An example was given of a workshop in Kashmir University, where 100 students showed up. Gora usually starts his presentations by asking how many have used computers before, and then goes on to ask how many have used Windows, etc. However, in this crowd only two people had ever used computers at all before. Yet they came to the meeting and were eager to get involved!</p><p><strong>KDE 4.2 localization</strong></p><p><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://bp0.blogger.com/_t-eJZb6SGWU/SE0k--HCB1I/AAAAAAAADN4/IK2pMv50y78/S220/raviratlami.JPG"" alt="""" width=""100"" height=""118"" /><a href=""http://raviratlami.blogspot.com/"">R. Shrivastava</a> has been working on localization of KDE 4.2. He also showed off how the KDE applications work well running natively in Windows. We discussed a bit how to come up with good terminology in Hindi, since there is a balance between simply taking all the English words and spelling them in Devanagari (which is what most cell phone ads in India seem to do), and on the other extreme use obscure terms for downloading or computer that some government agency has come up with, but which are very foreign to the users. He explained that they had tried to strike a balance, using a language that felt natural.</p><p>We also discussed what kind of tools could be used, especially to access translation memories from other projects, and other languages. Many of the Northern Indian languages are very similar, such as Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Marathi, Bhojpuri and Nepali (although with some exceptions written in different scripts). If one is doing a Hindi translation and is stuck on a term, it might thus be useful to be able to quickly look up how they translated it in Punjabi, etc. I am not sure if KBabel for example has this functionality today - it would be useful for other language groups as well, such as Norwegian, Swedish and Danish, or Finnish and Estonian.</p><p><strong>Publishing in Indian languages using TeX</strong></p><p><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://lh3.ggpht.com/shaklev/SJ_4t1QUJ0I/AAAAAAAACOc/HcgUzNms7hc/s288/100_0419.JPG"" alt="""" width=""254"" height=""288"" />Dr. C. S. Yogananda is a professor of mathematics, and has often helped arrange the math olympics. TeX is a publishing package that separates content from display, and is especially often used in the sciences and math, because it has powerful capabilities to display mathematical formulas, etc.</p><p>He described how earlier versions of TeX available for Indian languages required a pre-processor, but that he had developed a version that did not, and was thus much easier to use. He has already developed a version in Kannada, and believes that a one week workshop with participants from different language groups would be enough to produce TeX packages for all the Indian languages using the same framework.</p><p>He also discussed localization, and his own belief that mere translation was not enough. He took as example <a href=""http://gcompris.net"">GCompris</a>, a package of games for children, and talked about how localization implied changing some games that Indian kids were not familiar with, updating pictures to reflect Indian realities, changing maps so that they were more relevant, etc.</p><p>He also talked about early Indian typewriters, stating that if they had been designed from scratch only inspired by the Western models, instead of taking Western models and keeping the same amount of keys, etc, just exchanging for Indic language letters, people might have been much more comfortable typing in Indic languages. (He gave an example from a Supreme Court judge who told that previous to the typewriter, all court deliberations had been in Kannada, but after the advent of the typewriter, it had been so difficult to type in Kannada, that they had switched to English). Even today there are apparently some issues in the Unicode space for Kannada which also makes Kannada computing difficult.</p><p>They have been working on Kannada OCR, which is currently 95% finished. Instead of using an existing framework, they started from scratch. Hopefully this will be finished in another 6 months. Finally he showed examples of a Kannada-English dictionary that had been produced using their system, with thousands of pages, and all the indexing etc, using the advanced functionality in TeX. As far as I understood, this dictionary will later be released openly on the web, after a two year exclusivity agreement with a publishing company has lapsed.</p><p>One thing that I found peculiar is that the entire input in the TeX source files (which are later processed and turned into PDFs or other output formats) is written not using a Kannada font, but in latin letters - &#8220;transcribed&#8221;. He insisted that the system for input was logical, and that they were able to input at high speed using this system, but I thought to myself, what if India had invented the computer, and somebody had forced me to input my latest Norwegian poetry, or novel, using Norwegian transcribed into Devanagari alphabet? This concept is still strange to me.</p><p><strong>Oriya lexicon</strong></p><p><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://lh3.ggpht.com/shaklev/SJ_4zVjimXI/AAAAAAAACO8/2FXVYBBFhgI/s288/100_0426.JPG"" alt="""" width=""288"" height=""272"" />Dr. N. M. Pattnaik started out with a fascinating history of dictionaries in <a href=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriya"">Oriya</a>. The first dictionary dates back to the 17th Century, and was written for poets. As such, the words were alphabetized based on the last letters, not the first (to improve rhyming), and the meanings of each word were given in a poem. In the 18th Century, missionaries started producing dictionaries and grammars to aid them in their work, but these dictionaries were organized subject wise. In 1916 the first etymological dictionary in Oriya appeared. Then, between 1930 and 1940 a gigantic dictionary of 7 volumes and 10,000 pages was produced. This dictionary contained 185,000 head words, with translations in English, Hindi and Bengali. Unfortunately, only 200 copies were sold, and most of the other copies were destroyed due to rights disputes with the publisher and the heir.</p><p>This amazing dictionary, which is of course an incredibly important part of the linguistic and cultural history, not just of Orissa, but all of India, has been scanned and made available through Pattnaik&#8217;s organization. They did it using very simple equipment - a digital camera on a wooden stand, and a huge amount of manual editing and post-processing. The resulting 600 MBs have not yet been put on the internet, but I received a copy, and I will post it to archive.org as soon as I am back in Canada in a few weeks (with good broadband). Sneakernet across the world.</p><p>This dictionary represented the peak of Oriya dictionary making, and in the small dictionaries published today, one cannot even find modern words like nuclear or electron. There were also glossaries produced by government committees, but these consisted of scientists that never used Oriya in their own work, and were often were unnatural. In addition, the committees were based on subject field, so a given word, used in many subjects, might be translated differently in every committee.</p><p>His organization mainly works on making science fun for kids, and believes that this has to be done in their own language. However, scientists are often not very good in local languages (since most of their education and work happens in English), and so they need good lists of scientific terminology in Oriya and English.</p><p>Dr. Pattnaik&#8217;s organization generated a database of 20,000 Oriya-Oriya popular words, through the help of science writers who have long experience in popularizing technology and science in the Oriya language. They also produced an English-Oriya dictionary which currently has 6,000 words, and they hope it will reach 15,000 words soon. They will also add explanations in Oriya of terms, and reverse the database to generate an Oriya-English database as well. All this is available in <a href=""http://stardict.sourceforge.net/"">StarDict format</a>, which means that it can be easily used in applications for Mac, Linux, and Windows. As well, they have contributed word lists to <a href=""http://aspell.net"">aspell</a>, to improve spell-checking for Oriya on Linux.</p><p><strong>Assamese localization of GNOME<br /></strong></p><p>This was presented by Gora, since the fellow A. Phukan could not be present. Phukan works with RedHat, which has been doing a lot of localization work, and lately working on an interface for submitting translations through the web (similar to LaunchPad, but perhaps more open source).</p><p>Assamese is closely related to Bengali and Oriya, and is spoken in Assam. <a href=""http://cdac.in"">C-DAC</a> has already done valuable work localizing software, however they don&#8217;t work closely with the community, and thus use too formal words that are unnatural to users, and when they are done, just hand off the results and leaves - whereas software localization is something that has to happen continually in a process.</p><p>In addition to localization work, Phukan has also created an <a href=""http://www.xobdo.org/"">online dictionary of Assamese</a>, based on user contributions.</p><p><strong>Marathi and Urdu User Guide to Open Office</strong></p><p><img class=""alignleft"" style=""float: left;"" src=""http://lh6.ggpht.com/shaklev/SJ_44GMK46I/AAAAAAAACPA/BZsxFHv9jRI/s288/100_0427.JPG"" alt="""" width=""288"" height=""216"" />This was also presented by Gora. <a href=""http://svs.org.in/"">Sarvangin Vikas Sansthan</a> use &#8220;reversed rewards&#8221; to get localization done.

In this project, they translated the 380+ page user guide to OpenOffice into Marathi and Urdu. One thing I noticed from the screenshots was that they were based on non-localized versions of OO.org (ie. with English menus, etc).</p><p>The organization also does a lot of training in OpenOffice an other OSS software in schools in Maharashtra.</p><p>I will write about day 2 in a separate post.</p><p>Stian</p>","Heartburn Home Remedy => Hey, cool tips.

Since I also think it&#8217;s extremely important to get more students involved in this movement, and conversation, I was very excited to see that the <a href=""http://www.hewlett.org"">Hewlett Foundation</a> had provided for four student scholarships, to be determined by an essay. And now I have just been told that I am one of the winners, which is a real honor. After spending my own money attending the conference in Dalian, and iCommons last year, it feels like a wonderful recognition. I was encouraged by a friend to post my essay online, so here is what I submitted. I am hoping to see a lot of you in Logan, and I am also excited to meet the three others that won the scholarships.</em></p><p>&#8212;</p><p>A few days ago, I was visiting the university library of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in Varanasi, India, one of the most well known universities in India. Although it is housed in a grand building, I was struck by the extremely bad condition of the books, and the almost complete lack of any recent literature. In the section on libraries, the most recent book was from 1980, and books about library automatization from 1965 were prominently displayed. While seeing this, I tried to imagine studying or conducting research in such an atmosphere.</p><p>The various open movements carry the promise of broadening access to learning and research to much larger parts of the world, and to enable the students at BHU not only to receive a top-class education, but also later to conduct cutting-edge research, and to share their research with the rest of the world. Open access to research is crucially important for researchers, but also for students. Open educational resources introduce students to a field, and at higher levels, provide the contextual and pedagogical glue between pieces of research. New models of open and collaborative learning and teaching, such as the &#8220;Wiley wikis&#8221;, provide models of the process through which open learning can happen.</p><p>Although a participant in the North-American and worldwide English-speaking community of educators and thinkers, I come to the field with a number of perspectives. My mother tongue is Norwegian, spoken by only five million people, and this, together with my childhood experiences with Esperanto, incalculated in me an understanding of inequality in linguistic issues, and a deep passion for supporting national and regional languages. My educational background is in development studies, and spending more than 1,5 years in China, 1 year in Indonesia and several months each in Mexico, Russia and India, as well as speaking fluently eight languages has allowed me begin to see things from a multitude of national and cultural perspectives.</p><p>Having a background as a technology tinkerer, I am fascinated by the different new platforms offered for online teaching and learning. Having been active in political and social groups, I am extremely curious about ways of online cooperation and equitable governance that we can develop (especially across language barriers). I am also participating in a long-ranging conversation about &#8220;the future of the university&#8221;, or the peer2peer university - which includes thinking about factors that support informal learning, as well as accreditation, and rethinking the structure of &#8220;courses&#8221; or &#8220;degrees&#8221;. I got involved in this conversation at iCommons in 2007, and it resurfaced at the Open Learning conference in Dalian, and will be discussed both at the iCommons 2008 and the Open Education conference in Utah (if our proposal is accepted).</p><p>Two of the most interesting research (and advocacy) topics for me are how open educational resources are being used - whether by self-learners, or by educators who adapt them, as well as the issue of translation and cultural adaptation. I bring these two topics together in my MA thesis proposal, where I plan to do a qualitative study of the adaptation and use of MIT OCW materials in Chinese university courses. China is perhaps the country after the USA that has most aggressively both adapted foreign OCW, and began producing their own (Chinese Quality OCW, CQOCW), supported by organizations like CORE. Statistics show that several hundred Chinese courses are currently based partially on translated MIT OCW materials, but we know very little about what part of the material they use, how they adapt it, and what the pedagogical and non-pedagogical outcomes of this is.</p><p>Participating in the Dalian Open Learning conference was a wonderful experience for me, meeting many of the people active in the open learning community in person. At the same time, it made me sad to see the great divide between the Chinese researchers (almost 50% of the participants), and the rest. Both because of linguistic and cultural differences, there was sadly far too little exchange and mutual learning going on - and the non-Chinese participants probably lost out the most.</p><p>The different open movements are ideally leading to a &#8220;flatter&#8221; world, which can highlight the best quality material no matter where in the world it is produced. Yet so far, the spread of materials has been very one-sided, with material being produced in the US and translated into other languages. The Indian IIT&#8217;s, which some say are on par with or better than MIT, have began publishing lectures on Youtube, and English-speaking students can now choose if they want physics explained by an MIT professor, or one from IIT. But I have yet to hear a single US university or organization announce that they will begin translating Chinese courses (of which there are over a thousand available online currently) into English.</p><p>I expect to learn a huge amount from the conference, and come home with my mind swirling with new ideas. I hope to make new connections - people from around the world with whom I can collaborate and learn from long after the conference has ended. Hopefully I will hear about great intiatives that I can emulate through the Open &amp; Free @ University of Toronto network, which I will try to revitalize this fall. But I also hope to be injecting my own perspectives into the debates - perspectives of multilingualism, of developing countries, of end-users, and of undergraduate students - having just graduated from an undergraduate degree myself. And of course, I will spread what I learn - through my blog (syndicated at oerblogs.org), lectures and activities at the University of Toronto School of Education, and in other ways.</p><p>Thank you for considering my application.<br />Stian Haklev</p>",Mencerdaskan Bangsa &#8211; An Inquiry into the Phenomenon of Taman Bacaan in Indonesia,"asia,development,libraries,personal,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/09/20/mencerdaskan-bangsa-an-inquiry-into-the-phenomenon-of-taman-bacaan-in-indonesia/,"<p>During my undergraduate degree in International Development Studies, we had to spend a year working in a developing country, and develop a thesis based on primary research conducted in that country.

Although the thesis has been available at <a href=""http://hdl.handle.net/1807/10319 "">T-SPACE</a> since April, I have held back on sharing it with most of the people that assisted me, because I wanted the Indonesian version to be available for distribution.</p><p>I am contributing both language versions to <a href=""http://eprints.rclis.org"">E-LIS</a>, but their approval is taking too long, so I am also publishing the files here on my blog.</p><p>English abstract:</p><blockquote><p>Since 2001, a movement of individuals, neighbourhood and community organizations and NGOs starting and running their own libraries has emerged in Indonesia. Called Taman Bacaans (TBs) - reading gardens - these simple libraries, often hosted in somebody&rsquo;s house, or in a community building, provide easy and informal access to books, as well as frequent literacy programming. This thesis traces the historical heritage of these TBs back to the early renting libraries of peranakan Chinese in the 19th century, through Balai Pustaka and the public library movement under Sukarno. The modern TB emerges in the 1980s, the government attempts a wide-scale implementation of TBs in the 1990s, and a community movement finally emerges in 2001.<br />Using interviews with informants and newspaper articles, blogs, mailing lists, and NGO and government reports, I describe the process of how the TB movement emerges in Bandung and Yogyakarta. I also identify a number of factors that enabled and supported the movement: inspiring individual role-models, &ldquo;best-case&rdquo; libraries, networks and the roles of Islam and nationalism. Finally I provide an overview of the situation today, combining government statistics with the results of a survey conducted in Jakarta, and show that there are three kinds of TBs: those set-up by national, regional or local government (TBMs), those funded by large-scale donors, and independent TBs grounded in the local communities. I conclude with a number of recommendations for government and donors.</p><p>Indonesian abstract:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sejak tahun 2001, di Indonesia telah ada suatu pergerakan dari kalangan individu, tingkat rukun tetangga (RT) dan organisasi kemasyarakatan serta LSM yang memulai dan menjalankan perpustakaan mereka. Perpustakaan-perpustakaan sederhana ini dikenal sebagai Taman Bacaan (TB). Lokasi mereka sering di rumah seseorang atau di dalam sebuah bangunan umum, dan menyediakan akses yang mudah dan bersifat informal untuk buku-buku dan banyak kegiatan-kegiatan literasi. Tesis ini menelusuri kembali sejarah tentang TB mulai dari masa persewaan buku oleh keturunan Cina di abad 19, melalui Balai Pustaka dan pergerakan perpustakaan umum di masa pemerintahan Sukarno. TB modern mulai muncul di tahun 1980, lalu pemerintah mencoba menerapkan TB berskala besar di tahun 1990, dan pada akhirnya pergerakan masyarakat muncul di tahun 2001.<br />Berdasarkan wawancara dengan para sumber informasi, artikel-artikel di surat kabar, blog dan milis serta laporan NGO dan pemerintah, saya memaparkan proses munculnya pergerakan TB di Bandung dan Yogyakarta. Saya juga menunjukkan sejumlah faktor-faktor yang dapat dan mendukung pergerakan tersebut, yaitu: inspirasi tokoh teladan, &#8220;perpustakaan kasus terbaik&#8221;, jaringan-jaringan serta peran Islam dan nasionalisme. Di bagian akhir saya memberikan ihktisar mengenai situasi hari ini, yang menggabungkan statistik pemerintah dengan hasil survei yang dilakukan di Jakarta, yang menunjukkan ada tiga jenis TB, yaitu: TB yang dibentuk oleh pemerintah nasional, regional dan daerah, TB yang didanai oleh donor berskala-besar, dan TB independen yang didirikan oleh masyarakat setempat. Saya juga melampirkan beberapa rekomendasi bagi pemerintah dan para penyumbang.</p></blockquote><p>Files: <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/Mencerdaskan Bangsa - Stian Haklev2.pdf"">English thesis</a> and the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/Mencerdaskan Bangsa - bahasa indonesia2.pdf"">Indonesian translation</a> (without illustrations to reduce filesize)</p><p>Both are under Creative Commons BY license.

(<em>Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if people were able to interract with MIT&#8217;s site, remixing content, creating lenses or their own portals?</em>)</p><p>They also syndicate their content through for example <a href=""http://www.apple.com/education/itunesu/"">iTunes University</a> and their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/mit?ob=4"">YouTube channel</a>. An interesting new initiative to make content more accessible is to provide closed captioning on YouTube videos - like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faJ8RXQkk3o"">this one</a> (<em>while this is awesome, why not upload it to <a href=""http://dotsub.com"">dotSub</a>, which allows you to downlod videos with subtitles, and allow collaborative subtitling online - so that groups like <a href=""http://ocw.universia.net"">Universia</a> and <a href=""http://www.core.org.cn/"">CORE</a> could contribute translated subtitles?).</em> They&#8217;ve been working with <a href=""http://3playmedia.com/"">3playmedia</a>, who I think will present later this week, on developing the transcription system.</p><p>Finally, MIT was proud of their <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/about/media/elsevier_announce/elsevier_announce.htm"">publisher agreements with for example Elsevier</a>, which enables MIT to publish select material from Elsevier journals as part of MIT courses, with Creative Commons licenses.</p><p><a href=""http://ocw.universia.net/""><strong>Universia</strong></a> gave a curious presentation. They talked about the fact that they had translated metadata for OCW courses into ten languages, and also normalized the tags used to tag lectures or courses, so that they were consistent accross languages and courses. The main reason for this seemed to be search-engine optimization (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization"">SEO</a>) for OCW, and they proudly showed off the statistics showing the numbers of hits increasing - noting for example that the first Google hit on a particular search in Arabic was a course in Universia. But if the user clicks through, she finds out that all the material is still in Spanish&#8230; Is this particularly helpful to an Arabic user? We obviously want to increase the visibility and findability of our offerings, but by translating huge amounts of metadata before translating the courses, one runs the risk of being accused of spamming search engines, and annoying people instead of helping them.</p><p><a title=""Japanese Garden"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/27917561@N00/470937597/"" target=""_blank""><img class=""alignleft"" style=""border: 0pt none;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/213/470937597_fd2323e61a_m.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Japanese Garden"" width=""240"" height=""180"" /></a><a href=""http://www.jocw.jp/""><strong>Japanese OCW</strong></a> is interesting, in that they currently have 21 university members, 5 non-profit organizations and 11 companies.

(<em>So far, these companies are not listed on JOCW&#8217;s homepage either, which is quite unhelpful, since it doesn&#8217;t even link to the different courses.

The last few summers I have had one recurring problem that nobody could really give me good information about, and which was very stressful. Now that I have found some more information about this (the hard way), I decided to put it up here to share it with others in the same situation.</p><p><strong>Leaving Canada while trying to extend your student permit<br /></strong>The problem I have had is that for various reasons I never got a student permit that covered the entire time I was studying in Canada, and so I had to keep renewing my student permit almost every year. This is annoying, since it costs about $150. The problem was that the registrar&#8217;s office at <a class=""zem_slink"" title=""University of Toronto Scarborough"" rel=""wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto_Scarborough"">University of Toronto at Scarborough</a> refused to issue a letter saying I was registered as a student in a given year, before I had actually chosen some courses - however course selection doesn&#8217;t open up until June. At that time, I was usually in some other country working or travelling.</p><p>As an aside, you definitively want to extend your student permit, as opposed to applying for a new one. Applying for a new one is done in your home country, needs more paperwork and documentation, more money, more waiting time, and potentially having to re-do the medical test, etc. On the other hand, as long as you apply before your permit runs out, you can apply to extend your permit, by sending it to <a class=""zem_slink"" title=""Vegreville, Alberta"" rel=""wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegreville%2C_Alberta"">Vegreville, Alberta</a> (I actually looked it up on Google maps one time).</p><p>How long does this take? It varies - last year it took about a month, this year it took 40 days. However, the very neat secret is that as long as you apply for an extension before your student permit expires, you can keep studying until you get the answer - legally. This is clearly stated on the CIC webpage. What is not mentioned anywhere is what happens if you happen to leave the country in the middle of this, and have to re-enter.</p><p><em>What I used to do<br /></em></p><p>My normal strategy to get around this was to prepare all the papers, fill out the forms and sign them etc, and then have my room mate or another friend send in the complete application once the final documents arrived. I would then hope that the permit arrived in time, have my room mate FedEx it to <a class=""zem_slink"" title=""Norway"" rel=""wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"">Norway</a>, or wherever I was (sometimes I would have it sent to Buffalo, land there, pick it up, and take the bus across the border). This worked, although it was very often in the nip of time that I received the document.</p><p><em>Not this summer</em></p><p>This summer it took longer than usual because I was starting my masters. After my initial application, they issues me a conditional letter of acceptance, conditional upon my completion of my BA (reasonable demand). This meant that first UTSC had to process my graduation, which they did by mid June, then these documents had to be sent to OISE so that they could process them, and issue the final acceptance letter. This took for ever, and I actually ended up sending in the application the conditional acceptance letter + the graduation diploma (and this worked - although on my student permit it said: send in the full acceptance letter next time you are applying for an extension). The &#8220;no objections&#8221; final acceptance letter arrived in mid-July.</p><p>So my friend had submitted my application, and we were waiting. After a while, it became clear that I would not get an answer in time (there is a page on CIC when you can see the average wait times for different categories of applications). Clearly, skipping the crucial first weeks of class, where you choose your courses, meet your supervisor, attend orientation events etc, was not an option, so I was wondering what to do. I knew that in theory I should be allowed to study in Canada, since my friend had submitted the application in time (and I had the <a class=""zem_slink"" title=""Registered mail"" rel=""wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_mail"">registered mail</a> receipt to prove it), but I wasn&#8217;t very keen on arriving at the border without the actual document. I tried googling, reading everything I could on the CIC page, and even contacting the International Center as <a class=""zem_slink"" title=""University of Toronto"" rel=""wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto"">UofT</a> (which gave me patently <em>wrong</em> information), but found nothing. Finally I just had to try.</p><p><strong>At the border</strong></p><p>After a gruelling 26 hours on the plane (and after embarassingly having missed a flight for the first time in my life the previous day), I arrived at <a class=""zem_slink"" title=""Toronto Pearson International Airport"" rel=""geolocation"" href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=43.6772222222,-79.6305555556&amp;spn=0.03,0.03&amp;q=43.6772222222,-79.6305555556%20%28Toronto%20Pearson%20International%20Airport%29&amp;t=h"">Lester B. Pearson international airport</a> in Toronto. I waited in line, and finally got to the booth. I showed my expired student permit, and explained that I had applied in time, I also showed my registered mail receipt and my acceptance letter. He wrote some letters on my form which means &#8220;you need to go to see the real immigration guys&#8221;.</p><p>I went into the other office and waited in line. When I got to the front, they were not surprised at all, but handled it very routinely. They tried to look-up my application in their system, but it hadn&#8217;t registered yet (since Vegreville hadn&#8217;t even gotten as far as opening the envelope - a month after they had received it). However, as a Norwegian I qualify for a tourist visa for six months, and they gave me this, saying that as long as I kept those documents with me I would have &#8220;implied status&#8221;, and it would be legal to study in Canada. When I got the student permit, I could just staple it to my passport, and I would be good - I didn&#8217;t have to leave and re-enter the country.</p><p><strong>My second time at the border</strong></p><p>I was of course extremely happy to be allowed in to Canada, since I was quite worried - I certainly didn&#8217;t want to be deported. However, not having the student permit was still a nuisance, since I couldn&#8217;t register to get a SIN card and get paid for my work as a graduate assistant, etc. As it happened, I had to leave Canada again before receiving the permit - I went to a conference in Utah. This time, upon coming back, the same thing happened (this time I was a bit more routined, and less stressed out). When they looked up my name, they said: Yes, you have gotten it, until July 30th. They then wrote July 30th in my passport, and sent me on my way. And when I got back to the apartment, the student permit was waiting for me.</p><p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p><p><em>First of all, I am not a lawyer or an immigration advisor - this is just my own experience. Yours might be different, and these rules and regulations might also change without warning.</em></p><p>If you apply for a student permit before your current one runs out, you can stay in Canada and study until you receive a reply. If you leave the country in the meantime, and you are eligible for a tourist visa, you can re-enter the country without any problems. It would be useful if you had an original copy of the registered mail receipt (I only had a copy), a copy of the application you sent in (I didn&#8217;t have it, but they asked for one), as well as your admittance letter (I did have this). <em>Note that if you are from a country that requires a visa even for tourists, such as China, this would probably work differently!</em></p><p>Another tentative conclusion is that since they can at any time access my immigration records on their computer, I might not have to have the student permit fedex&#8217;ed to me in the future - as long as it has been issues, they will be able to admit me as a student (this should apply to people who need student permits as well).</p><p>Note as I wrote above that you will still need your student permit for applying for a SIN card, and often your school&#8217;s registrar will pester you for a copy etc. If at all possible, send in the application as early as possible.</p><p>I hope this is useful to the small group of people it touches, because this information would have made my life a lot easier if I had known it a few months or years ago.

I did a quick count, and from what I saw, in the first list (almost all male), 17 out of 25 had some kind of personal URL, whereas among the all-female list, only 4 (of which two were hosted at their company) had a personal URL.</p><p>No hard and fast conclusions to draw from that, this is obviously not a representative sample, but I wonder if it means anything&#8230; That the men are more focused on promoting themselves as a brand, whereas the women are more interested in communicating?

This week, we had to write a reflection paper to apply some of these theories on a topic of our choosing, to prove that we had understood them. I chose to write an imagined (and exaggerated) dialogue about the MIT Open CourseWare. Don&#8217;t take this too seriously, and none of these necessarily reflect my own views. </em></p><p><strong>The International Debate on the MIT Open CourseWare</strong></p><p><em>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Economist&#8217;s annual policy maker debate hosted at Oxford University. This year we will be presenting the statement &ldquo;MIT Open CourseWare and similar projects help promote educational equality in the world, and should be promoted&rdquo;. We have a distinguished panel tonight. Our first section will focus on the national American context, and Professor Compensatory Liberal will go first.<br /></em><br /><strong>Professor Compensatory Liberal</strong>: Dear attendees, I support today&#8217;s statement. America benefits from its wide variety of educational providers, both private and public, and we are proud of the diversity and entrepreneurialism evident in our educational system. However, there are large groups that are under-served and lack access to high-quality education, whether this is due to financial difficulties, or an inflexible life-situation. Making high-quality courses from one of America&#8217;s premier institutions available to these citizens will go a long way in compensating for this lack of access, and will hopefully set an example that other institutions can follow.</p><p><strong>Professor Pure Liberal</strong>: I disagree with this statement. Having a large and diverse body of educational providers, including public, private and for-profit actors, is &ndash; as my esteemed colleague stated &ndash; one of the strengths of our nation. It is quite appropriate that educational services should come at a cost, because they are very expensive to provide, and it is fair &ndash; countless studies have shown that gaining a college degrees is an investment that pays for itself several times in increased lifetime income. The state has decided to subsidy a part of this cost, because the positive externality of increasing the educational level of the population is so high that without a subsidy, less education would be consumed than is socially optimal. However, providing education for free completely distorts the market place, and risks putting for-profit providers out of business, and decreasing the competition in the market, thus hurting the consumer.</p><p><strong>Professor Pure Liberal 2</strong>: Esteemed colleague, I respectfully disagree. While all your premises are well stated, you do not accurately consider the function of MIT Open CourseWare. Since MIT does not provide accreditation, which is what most educational consumers ultimately seek, MIT OCW does not compete with other educational providers. Instead, it provides very valuable functions for MIT. Primarily, it is a marketing tool, which has helped shore up MIT&#8217;s reputation as the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; for engineering training in the world. 60% of all incoming students cite MIT OCW as a factor in their choosing the institution. Internally, the courses are also very helpful to students selecting classes, or wanting to review material. Therefore, MIT OCW is a shrewd strategy from MIT to better position themselves in the market, and compete for students. This is a legitimate part of doing business, and something we should be supporting.</p><p><strong>Professor Socialist</strong>: First to the previous speaker, I resent the notion that education is a good to be consumed. Education in a socialist society would be a human right. The education provided at MIT however, is an elite education for the capitalist managerial class which is completely inaccessible to the working class. The OCW project is simply a ploy to detract attention from the fact that working class children are excluded from attending MIT, and taking advantage from close interaction with professors, experience working in labs, the participation in learning communities, etc. This kind of quality education will always be unavailable to ordinary students in a capitalist system.</p><p><strong>Professor Socialist 2</strong>: Esteemed colleague, I respect your views, but in this case I will have to disagree. You speak almost enviously of MIT as high quality education. Remember that universal education was instituted to socialize children into workers who could show up on time, work sustained for long periods of time, and not question authority. It is true that transformatory learning based on for example the Freirian model can be a powerful act of resistance in a capitalist society, however what MIT does is to take the most creative youth and mold them into model workers for the &ldquo;innovation economy&rdquo;. Their newest project to spread their educational materials to everyone, is simply a ploy to get working class men and women studying and improving their skills for free in their own time, which will benefit the companies they work for, but not themselves.</p><p><em>Well, we thank you for your views on MIT Open CourseWare in the American context. Now we are widening the scope of the debate, to consider the impact of MIT Open CourseWare on the international stage, and we have a mix of American and international contributors. Professor American Realist?<br /></em><br /><strong>Professor Liberal Internationalist</strong>: Every human being in the world has an equal right to education and personal development. The current situation is that educational opportunities are very inequitably distributed throughout the world, and in many countries youth lack access to quality higher education. As a world community, we need to come together to pull up those who need it. The MIT OCW is a wonderful project that let&#8217;s anyone in the world be a &ldquo;fly on the wall&rdquo; of the MIT, and radically widens access to one of the world&#8217;s premier research and teaching institutions. Hopefully many similar projects will be created, so that we will have a chance of reaching the Millenium Development Goals.</p><p><strong>Professor American Realist</strong>: If this project was simply available inside America, using a similar license to the one developed in the Australian school system, which limits usage to the national context, the situation would be very different. Strengthening the human capital in the US, leading to a strengthening of both the commercial productivity, and perhaps also our armies would certainly be a laudable objective. However, America&#8217;s educational system, the best in the world, is a key to our national competitiveness on the world stage. By making these resources available internationally, you are undermining our key advantage, and in extremis threatening the global American hegemony that preserves world peace and our prosperity.</p><p><strong>Professor American Realist 2</strong>: While I wholeheartedly agree with the assessment made by my colleague, I wanted to add that security, and failed states, is a large concern for us at the moment. If it could somehow be shown that MIT OCW could increase the human capital in conflict zones, and reduce the probability for conflict, even by a small amount, this would be something quite support-worthy. Of course, access should not be extended to the whole world, but only to the areas that national defence and security dictate that we help.</p><p><strong>Professor Australian Pure Liberal</strong>: I want to reiterate the concern that my colleague Professor Pure Liberal espoused earlier. The international trade in educational services is one of the fastest rising sectors of the economy, and one that brings benefits both to exporting countries and importing countries. These free resources constitute an unfair challenge to our producers of learning materials who have contributed so much to the increase of quality learning opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region, and serves to incalculate in people the belief that very expensive learning resources ought to be free, thus undermining future increases in this global trade.</p><p><strong>Professor Neo-institutionalist</strong>: There is already a trend of increasing convergence among educational systems in different nation states, as they tend to align themselves with the &ldquo;imagined community&rdquo; of the global modern society. Programs such as MIT OCW make important contributions to this process, by sharing the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; educational materials, which help shape expectations around curriculum among universities, students and lecturers.</p><p>In fact, Chinese universities have produced more than 250 book-length comparative reports on the differences between MIT OCW curricula and the curricula taught in Chinese schools, with the express purpose to improve the quality of education in China to &ldquo;international standards&rdquo;. Indeed, not only the educational content itself, but also the pedagogical methods and lecture styles are being transmitted through the videos available, and many professors in developing countries have reported modifying their own teaching based on this. Such a global convergence towards a &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; is a natural and positive process, and MIT OCW is a wonderful contribution to this.</p><p><strong>Professor Latin-American World-system Theorist</strong>: The previous speaker analyses the world without any relevant historical context, and presents a fairy-tale view of the global processes that actually take place. Research, scholarly publishing, and top university education is concentrated in the Anglo-Saxon centre of the world, all conducted in the English language according to a certain epistemology and grounded in a system of production. The MIT OCW has two distinct very negative effects on the developing countries of the world. Firstly, it legitimizes MIT as the global leader in teaching, and the material and knowledge that they are transmitting as the material &ldquo;most worth knowing&rdquo;, which will &ldquo;help us&rdquo; move ahead. Their knowledge is not relevant to a struggling developing country, and their ways of knowing block out the local and indigenous ways of knowing that we need to develop.</p><p>Secondly, it presents the illusion that everyone in the world have access to high quality education. These courses will merely benefit the urban elites in our countries, who already embrace Western knowledge and ideas of progress, to the detriment of their own people who cannot afford clean water, let alone an internet connection. In order to develop our educational system so that it truly benefits our people, we must close the windows to the flood of Western educational materials that are attempted introduced through loans, or even as &ldquo;free&rdquo;, and concentrate on our own language and heritage.</p><p><strong>Professor International Norms</strong>: The idea of freely and openly sharing educational resources is an emerging norm on the national and international arena. It&#8217;s an idea that traces its heritage back to the open source movement, and also to the very fundaments of science and the academia. It has been introduced by a number of norm entrepreneurs, such as MIT, the Hewlett Foundation, and individuals and groups that struggle to promote this norm, both in the US, and on the international arena.</p><p>They have had some success, with Open CourseWare projects started in many countries, for example Japan, Mexico, Korea, China, France and Holland, however the norm has still not reached the tipping point where it would lead to a norm cascade. Although a number of groups have signed on, no countries have as yet adopted open access to educational resources as a national norm, or something that they want to push in international fora. The creation of international networks often precedes this process, and an encouraging factor is that UNESCO has thoroughly endorsed this movement, and indeed were the ones who in 2002 coined the word &ldquo;open educational resources&rdquo;.</p><p>This movement has the potential to bring much benefit to the world, and contrary to what some previous speakers have alluded to, Open CourseWare is not an imperialist or capitalist ploy. The movement is very supportive of every country contributing and sharing of their valuable and unique material, and as mentioned, there is already OCW available from developing countries such as China, Vietnam and Mexico, which can be shared with the world. As one example, the Indian Institutes of Technology have put over thousand hours of video on Youtube.</p><p>In addition, because OCW utilizes an open license, the material can be remixed and adapted in many ways. Thus, the material can be translated to local languages, and edited to suit local conditions. (The same is of course true for Chinese and Japanese material &ndash; it can be translated to English, and used in American universities. Unfortunately, that does not seem to have happened yet). In this way, OCW indeed does constitute one global trend of sharing, but one that is equal, not a one-way transfer of knowledge and ideology from the West to the rest.</p><p><strong>Professor Global Transformer</strong>: The only way we can achieve an equitable and sustainable world is to prioritize grassroots initiatives that treasure local knowledge and locally produced products, together with a radically inclusive democracy. Although the model of the elite MIT university is anachronistic, and not worthy of emulation, the fact that is the MIT OCW material is presented with an open license. This means that we can repurpose it and borrow from it when we design our community adult education intiatives, and online peer-to-peer learning communities.

My mother tongue is Norwegian, but I also speak for example Italian, Spanish, Esperanto, Chinese and Indonesian. And English of course.</p><p>What language to use on the web is a tricky question. And some might consider me a bit of a hypocrite. I feel very strongly about linguistic diversity, and am all about encouraging Chinese, Hindi speakers and Norwegians to blog in their own languages, to create more web content in the languages less represented on the web. At the same time, I obviously understand the desire to reach out and be read by people all over the world. Personally, almost all my web activity is in English. I blog in English (I have had two different blogs in Chinese, but gave up when the only comment I ever got was &#8220;oh, so cute, your Chinese is really good&#8221;, and never about what I was writing about). I mostly edit English Wikipedia (although I have made contributions to the Norwegian, Indonesian and Chinese). I also do most of my reading in English (although I read some Norwegian dailies and blogs, and some Chinese). When I google for something, I always google in English - unless there is strong reason to expect there to more material in another language.</p><dl class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 434px;""><dt class=""wp-caption-dt""><a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/gaetanlee/298178764/""><img title=""Magnetic letters"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/106/298178764_37eac24f66.jpg?v=0"" alt=""(C) Gaetan Lee, licensed under CC BY"" width=""424"" height=""318"" /></a></dt></dl><p>This is why a recent post on <a href=""http://www.pontydysgu.org/2008/09/a-pleasant-surprise/#comment-10101"">My learning journey</a>, talking about how she had dived into the German webosphere, and found many interesting sites, resonated with me. I should probably spend more time surfing around in different linguistic blogospheres, but I feel I am already spending too much time on the net&#8230; One neat tool I came up with to encourage myself to be more linguistically diverse, is connected to Wikipedia. I usually look up a topic on English Wikipedia, because it usually has the longer, more complete articles - however I would be completely capable to check out the article in other languages. This tool automatically redirects you to the longest Wikipedia page on a given topic, given a range of languages that you speak.</p><p>Here is an example of usage: <a href=""../../bigger/en/no,da,sv,de,it/Democracy""><span class=""hilite"">http://reganmian</span>.net/bigger/en/no,da,sv,de,it/Democracy</a> This url says: I speak Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, German and Italian - give me the longest article you have on what in English is called Democracy. (This might seem very inconvenient, but if you save it as a keyword in Firefox, like http://reganmian.net/bigger/en/no,da,sv,de,it/%s, you can later type something like &#8220;bigger Frankenstein&#8221;, and it automatically redirects you.</p><p>One thing I would love to find though, are good websites in these languages where people &#8220;sum up&#8221; significant developments and trends in the national blogosphere for me. Often what I find, is people summing up the debates on Slashdot or Digg for the national audience - which is the last thing I want.</p><p><em>By the way, I am currently looking for examples of international students or faculty being encouraged to conducted research/publish in their home languages - any sources would be very welcome.</em></p><p>Stian<br /><em>Thanks to <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/gaetanlee/298178764/"">Gaetan Lee</a> @ flickr for the image, licensed under CC BY</em></p>","Stian Håklev => Pat, thanks for that comment.

I think random is a fascinating idea.   There is so much in the world to see, do, read. So many people, ideas, perspectives. Most people spend most of their time aware of only a tiny portion of what&#039;s out there.  If one knows more than one language, one can be aware of so much more.  One of my favorite words in the world is WYRYWKOWY.   Means random in Polish.  haven&#039;t figured out how to pronounce it yet..but am working on it.i do speak Spanish, but, yes, I have only websearched in English.  So far.  You bring up a good point..

Back then, even their website was incredibly fugly - that has improved a lot since then. I was so frustrated by the lack of a trip planner that I once tried writing one myself, when I was learning Ruby. I quickly gave up trying to screen-scrape and parse the data.

That is a huge increase, and what is unclear, since there is no information about this anywhere, is whether they suddenly imported a huge amount of books that had been lying around waiting for processing, or whether they have been continually adding books, without updating this number. I guess the future will show if this number will change on a daily basis or not.</p><p>While this is great, there seem to be some quality issues. First of all, many of the books I searched would not display the full text - when clicking on the link, nothing came up. Worse than that however, is that some scans seem to be very bad, to the point of useless. An egregious example that shows several weird artefacts is here:       <a href=""http://openlibrary.org/details/danskbiografisk00bricgoog""> Dansk biografisk lexikon</a>. This book - which was the second or third link that I clicked on, I did not go hunting for this example - is really strange. If you begin reading through it, the first you see is a Copyright page for <a class=""zem_slink"" title=""Google Book Search"" rel=""homepage"" href=""http://books.google.com/"">Google Books</a>! Weird, I did not know that <a class=""zem_slink"" title=""Open Content Alliance"" rel=""wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Content_Alliance"">OCA</a> included material from Google Books. The next few pages have pictures of a hand wearing a glove - this book scanner has been immortalized. And finally, once you start reading, there is what seems to be a curious mix of two different scans - one seems like it&#8217;s a Google Books scan, with the bright white background, and other an OCA scan with the yellowish background.</p><p>Interestingly, when you go to the <a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/danskbiografisk00bricgoog"">Internet Archive detail page</a> (which is of course separate from the <a href=""http://openlibrary.org/b/OL6968915M"">OpenLibrary archive page</a>), you find this information: Book digitized by Google and uploaded to the Internet Archive by user tpb.</p><p>Color me confused. I think this effort to make books available online is wonderful, but I fail to understand why they are not more participatory about it. On the OpenLibrary website, I cannot even flag a scan as faulty. And it is much harder for me to promote OpenLibrary when I speak about open access and open education, because I know so little about it. This seems to me to be shooting oneself in the foot.</p><p>(And we still really need to be able to scan in on pages in the flipbook view. The interface is great, but hasn&#8217;t been updated for a long time).</p><p>Stian</p><div class=""zemanta-pixie"" style=""margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;""><a class=""zemanta-pixie-a"" title=""Zemified by Zemanta"" href=""http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/dc38a296-8f3f-4b70-b52d-c02c70efacd0/""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" style=""border: medium none; float: right;"" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=dc38a296-8f3f-4b70-b52d-c02c70efacd0"" alt=""Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"" /></a></div>","What is happening with Universal Library?

When I present the ideas behind open access, and open educational resources, there is always someone who likens it to Western cultural imperialism, and how we will flood the rest of the world with our knowledge. Although not an argument to be taken lightly, I would argue that this is already happening, but that it is the developing countries themselves that can benefit the most from Open Access, also in terms of having their own knowledge spread! I really want to cite more authors from the countries that I do research in, but if I cannot access their writings, that is difficult - and sadly, even University of Toronto will not have subscriptions to many of these.</p><p>The Indian publisher <a href=""http://www.medknow.com/aboutus.asp"">MedKnow</a> is a great example of how Open Access can benefit journals published in developing countries. With over 65 open access journals, that don&#8217;t charge subscription fees, it might be the biggest open access publisher in the world. Through distribution online, not only has print subscriptions increased significantly, international submissions have gone up, and together with income from paper subscriptions, Google ads on the online site helps turn a small profit.

This was brought home to me when I began researching the community library movement in Indonesia (later published on <a href=""http://eprints.rclis.org/archive/00014659/"">E-LIS</a>). Not only was there almost no existing research available on my specific case - the community library movement in Indonesia - but to my great surprise, there was a huge dearth of research on community libraries for development in general.</p><p>The few studies that existed all &#8220;started from scratch&#8221;, and were usually simple descriptions of different individual cases, a <a href=""http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla71/papers/137e-Sarjant.pdf "">tent library in East-Africa</a> here, a <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6929404.stm"">mule library in Venezuela</a> there&#8230; But nobody tried to develop meta-studies, overviews, theories, taxonomies&#8230; What kinds of community libraries are there? What are the criteria for success? What theories exist on how community libraries effect local education? Economic participation? Citizenship and democracy?</p><p><strong>A map of the field</strong></p><p>What was lacking was not just individual theories, but what the OPLRN proposal calls &#8220;a map of the field&#8221;. This description has staid with me, because it fit so perfectly, not just the OER reality, but the &#8220;community libraries in developing countries&#8221; reality:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong></strong>&#8220;&#8230;In more established fields such as cancer research, there is a consensus map of the structure of the field, the major research questions, and the different sub-communities and associated methodologies. It is possible to place oneself on the map, and to coordinate effort in a well understood way. In contrast OER research is a relatively young field, which has not yet being fully articulated and defined&#8230;&#8221; </em></p><p>(from the OPLRN proposal, availably by <a href=""http://74.125.95.104/search?q=cache:UnmczomPY5wJ:iet-public-wiki.open.ac.uk/index.php/OPLRN_proposal+http://iet-public-wiki.open.ac.uk/index.php/OPLRN_proposal&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;client=firefox-a"">Google Cache</a>).</p></blockquote><p><strong>Only theories provide transferability</strong></p><p>Today I was reading <a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45951736&amp;referer=brief_results"">a collection of papers</a> by <a href=""http://www.iteachilearn.com/cummins/"">Jim Cummins</a>, a researcher on bilingualism and linguistic rights at <a href=""http://www.oise.utoronto.ca"">OISE</a>. A recurring theme is the disconnect between academic research and policy; there seems to be very strong evidence in the scientific literature for certain kinds of bilingual education, however, this is not translated into policy, especially in the US. In his paper &#8220;<a href=""http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ387333&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ387333"">The Role and Use of Educational Theory in Formulating Language Policy</a>&#8221; he states explicitly:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;A major reason why many policy-makers in the United States regard the research bias for bilingual education as minimal or even non-existent is that they have failed to realize that data or &#8216;facts&#8217; from bilingual programs become interpretable for policy purposes only within the context of a coherent theory. It is the </em><em>theory rather than the individual research findings that permits the generation of predictions about program outcomes under different conditions. Research findings themselves cannot be </em><em>directly applied across contexts. </em></p><p><em>[...]</em></p><p><em>In short, although research findings cannot be applied directly across contexts, theories are almost by definition applicable across contexts in that the validity of any theoretical principle is assessed precisely by how well it can account for the research findings in a variety of contexts. If a theory cannot account for a particular set of research findings, then it is an inadequate or incomplete theory.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>This really struck home with me. (Incidentally, after spending hours transcribing interviews with children on the nature of science, and trying to grade them from level 1 to 3 in &#8220;understanding of science&#8221;, I realized that maybe politicians need courses on using science for policy formulation as well.)</p><p><strong>Case study: Video for math education at Open Ed 2008</strong></p><p>So where does that leave us with OER? One of the things that struck me at the <a href=""http://cosl.usu.edu/events/opened2008/"">Open Education 2008</a> conference I participated in, at Utah State University, was that very few of the attendees were from faculties of education. Furthermore, I was quite frustrated by the quality of many of the presentations from a scholarly perspective. I promised my good friend Haishuo Lee during the conference that I would rip his presentation to pieces, so I will use that as an example here (with his permission). Haishuo&#8217;s university in Taiwan put video recordings of math classes online, and designed a summer course around this - so that incoming students who were admitted in spring could follow these math classes online during summer, take an exam, and if they passed, receive credit and not have to take this class again in fall.</p><p>They wanted to evaluate this initiative, and they conducted both surveys as well as analysis of the test results of various groups of students, and all this was presented very ably by Haishuo during the conference (he is a born presenter). All well and good, but to me this was a paper that lacked an introduction and a conclusion. Where was the &#8220;literature review&#8221;? If this was simply a program evaluation for internal use, that is one thing, but if this is presented as academic research, why would you design a study without consulting the literature? What previous research has been done in this field? What are the various theories? What can this study help prove/disprove or improve our understanding of?</p><p>One problem might be that many of the proponents of open education seem to think that this is something brand new, and thus there isn&#8217;t any &#8220;literature&#8221;. To a certain extent, that is true, but slow down&#8230; The reason this study was presented at Open Education 2008, was that the videos produced were made &#8220;open access&#8221; for the whole world. However, for the students enrolled in the university, it would have made no difference if they were closed access, and only available for enrolled students through a password&#8230; So basically, this was a study on the use of online multimedia resources for self-instructed math classes - and surely there would be reams of studies on this. The use of video in teaching has been written about since the 1970&#8217;s (in fact, I just found out that the first video ever to be released on VHS was the South-Korean film &#8220;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Teacher"">The young teacher</a>&#8220;).</p><p>And distance education has a very rich and long history of research, as is the case with instructional design, and the topic of math instruction itself. So while it might be very challenging to grapple with all these various disciplines, some theoretical foundation would mean that this study would not only help the Taiwanese university understand the strengths and failures of its own program better, but the study would make a contribution to the scholarly literature, and help inform projects at other universities, and perhaps eventually contribute to improving the theory itself.</p><p><strong>Where does that leave us?</strong></p><p>Note that I am picking on Haishuo as an example here, what I listed above was typical for most of the presentations. Granted, if you conceive of the conference more of a &#8220;meeting of geeks&#8221;, where we show each other the cool things we&#8217;ve come up with, this might be acceptable. But for me, who is in an MA program and wish to write both my final MA thesis, and a number of papers on the way, on different aspects of the OER movement, this presents a problem.</p><p>There are lot&#8217;s of possible angles. <a href=""http://www.educause.edu/Community/MemDir/Profiles/CandaceThille/58820"">Candace Thille</a> at <a href=""http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml"">CMU</a> leads the <a href=""http://www.cmu.edu/oli/"">Open Learning Initiative</a>, which is a great model of learning scientists working closely together with OER designers, and they have produced a wealth of new data and theoretical insights in what seems to be a very fruitful collaboration.

Currently I am thinking about my final paper, and one idea I had was to use the framework of policy lending and borrowing from <a href=""http://www.tc.edu/faculty/steiner-khamsi/pub.htm"">Gita Steiner-Khamsi</a> (see for example &#8220;<a href=""http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2248/is_157_40/ai_n13774375"">The Global Politics of Borrowing and Lending</a>&#8220;) to look at how the idea of Open CourseWare was taken up by the Chinese government.</p><p>But I need more. So I would love to get in touch with people who are researching open learning and open educational resources from different theoretical perspectives and disciplines, and pieces of research as well. Hopefully the new <a href=""http://oer.issuelab.org/research"">OER research repository</a> at <a href=""http://oer.issuelab.org/"">IssueLab</a> will help with this.</p><p><strong>China</strong></p><p>One quick note at the end, and this is something that I wish to explore more fully in a later post, is that the situation seems to be slightly different in China. During the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/05/01/open-learning-conference-in-dalian-2008-lessons-for-future-events/"">Open Education conference in Dalian</a> most of the Chinese participants seemed to be working for faculties of education (with many of them coming from the various open universities, thus having a background in distance education theory), and part of the &#8220;divide&#8221;, which I have written about before, was that the Chinese participants seemed to view the conference as an academic conference for them to share their research and findings, whereas the foreign participants saw it more as a place to exchange ideas and examples of what they themselves had done.</p><p>And indeed, recently I did a search for literature on the <a href=""http://iftf.typepad.com/virtualchina/2006/09/more_on_mit_ope.html"">Chinese OpenCourseware</a> project, sponsored by the Chinese government (often called China Quality OCW, CQOCW or CNQOCW - 精品课程 in Chinese), and was flabbergasted to find over 2,000 peer-reviewed articles (all in Chinese) on this topic. This is roughly as many articles as I could find about Open Courseware (MIT and other) in any other language put together - and while most of the Chinese articles were entirely about CQOCW (with most listing the term in their title), many of the articles in English mainly mention Open Courseware as one of many innovations in higher education, etc.</p><p>It will be very interesting, as I start conducting my research on this literature, what kind of theories and perspectives are employed, and how many of the articles are simply reports on a university&#8217;s own projects.</p><p>Stian</p>","On critically engaging with other people&#8217;s writing | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] just in a &#8220;this is neat&#8221; way.

I love the Swedish language, and often read Swedish novels, or download audiobooks (my latest experience was something like a total of 60 hours for the <a href=""http://www.stieglarsson.com/"">Stieg Larsson trilogy</a>).</p><p>Norway and Sweden are similar in many ways, and we both have our public broadcasters, which show generally high quality shows with no advertising. They have also been experimenting with the web, perhaps inspired by BBC, and both the Norwegian <a href=""http://nrk.no"">NRK</a> and the Swedish <a href=""http://svt.se"">SVT</a> (as well as the Danish <a href=""http://dr.dk"">DR</a>) have began streaming their video, and producing podcasts and vodcasts. This latter is important for me, because living in Canada, it has generally been impossible to watch high-quality streaming video. NRK produces some <em>great</em> shows, that I would love to watch, but alas it is almost impossible.</p><p>Imagine how impressed I became when I checked out SVT&#8217;s website and saw something called &#8220;<a href=""http://media.svt.se/play/playprima/"">Play Prima</a>&#8220;. At first, because of the title, I thought this was a system where you had to pay to access the material (this is common for Norway&#8217;s commercial channel, which uses payment by cellphone. Note that I would happily pay if I was able to watch content in high quality in Canada, but it&#8217;s only for streaming). In fact, Play Prima turned out to be comepletely free (and no sign-up, thank you) and offer very high quality streaming video of many of their TV series.</p><p>This is offered through a commercial provider (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_Networks"">Move Networks</a>), which has come up with a new way of streaming that is able to downshift and upshift quality very rapidly, and I am guessing they also have a global network of mirrors, something similar to Akamai. This is probably costing SVT a fair penny - then again, they have a mandate to provide quality programming to the Swedes, and since Sweden is one of the most wired countries in the world, it makes sense that the TV station has to follow. The advantage of the Nordics is also that their own programming is not in English, and therefore they don&#8217;t face the problem that BBC faces in justifying why the British public should pay tax money for the BBC providing great programming to the entire world (therefore, there is luckily no geo-ip blocking in place either).</p><p>All that background story to say that I clicked on a TV show randomly, and ended up watching a delightful three hour miniseries on an adopted African-Swedish boy whose biggest dream was to sign in a &#8220;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dansband"">Dansband</a>&#8220;, a group playing a particularly Swedish kind of very &#8220;danceable&#8221; music. This music is seen as &#8220;very white&#8221;, &#8220;very Swedish&#8221;, and the biggest audience is older people in small towns - thus, traditionally conservative. The show follows Lennart during his travails, until he finally puts together his own group, and after much ridicule and prejudice is able to reach his goal. Not only were the series very well made, but they also included <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fares_Fares"">Fares Fares</a>, a Syrian-Swedish who is one of my favorite Swedish actors, who has starred in several Swedish blockbusters.</p><p>After watching the series last night, I felt the need to read some of people&#8217;s and media&#8217;s reactions to it, and I googled around for a while. I chanced upon a thesis on the portrayal of adopted children in Swedish media, using this series as a case study, which luckily I was able to download from the <a href=""http://dspace.mah.se/dspace/handle/2043/6177"">Malm University institutional repository</a>. One of the points made by the thesis was that Lennart, as an adopted African, was culturally entirely Swedish - he grew up in a small town where everyone knew him, he spoke Swedish with a dialect, loved Swedish music, and felt uncomfortable in the &#8220;immigrant quarters&#8221; in Stockholm. Yet, everyone kept treating him as an immigrant with a different cultural heritage, and finally, although the ending could be seen as happy, he could only find success through a &#8220;dansband&#8221; made up almost entirely of immigrants&#8230; He could only be accepted as an immigrant, not as a native Swede.</p><p>I thought this was a very interesting point, and I was glad to have read the thesis to provide me with some perspective on the film. Turns out the author of the thesis was himself internationally adopted from Korea, who has later written about <a href=""http://webzone.k3.mah.se/projects/kjmag/viewarticle.aspx?articleID=52&amp;issueID=15"">his own experience</a> (in Swedish).</p><p>In the end I had two thoughts. The first was that I really appreciated the fact that I had, from Canada, gained a little insight into the national discourse on immigration, adoptees and racism that happens within Sweden - through two different kinds of open access. The first, making the TV series available online (apparently it was also viewed by 1,3 million people when shown on TV, out of a population of 9 million). And the second, Patrik making his thesis available in the institutional repository.</p><p>And I also wondered when I would see something similar from Canada. Hopefully racism is not as rampant here, but there are certainly enough issues of ethnicity to grab on to. <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/littlemosque/"">The Little Mosque on the Prairie</a> was quite good, and the book <a href=""http://www.bananaboys.com/"">Banana Boys</a> and the <a href=""http://fu-gen.org/20082009-season/"">play based on the book</a>, which I recently saw, were great.

Of course, computer language isn&#8217;t quite human language, but most computer languages today are heavily based on English, both in the built in functions, and in the libraries that people distribute. Thus, you write</p><blockquote><p>System.PrintScreen(&#8221;Hello&#8221;), and not Sistemo.SkribuEkrane(&#8221;Saluton&#8221;)</p></blockquote><p>I explained that most modern languages have very few built-in functions, and that as long as the interpreter or compiler supports UTF-8 variables and function names, you could theoretically rewrite all functions and variables to be in another language. Today, my friend forwarded me evidence that someone has gone much further.</p><p><a href=""http://www.chinesepython.org/cgi_bin/cgb.cgi/english/english.html"">Chinese Python</a> is a complete translation of Python into Chinese. Not only is all the documentation, and all the program feedback and error codes in Chinese, but you can write your entire program in Chinese - all the variables and function names can be in Chinese, and all the built-in functions are named in Chinese. Thus, instead of &#8220;if a=2&#8243; you write &#8220;如果 阿=2&#8243;, where 如果 is the Chinese word for &#8220;if&#8221;, and 阿 is the arbitrary name of your variable.</p><p>Here is a longer example for you to compare: (from <a href=""http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZhPy"">Chinese Wikipedia</a>).</p><p><strong>Chinese Python:</strong></p><pre><code><span style=""color: #993300;"">#!/usr/bin/env zhpy# 檔名: while.py數字 = 23運行 = 真當 運行:    猜測 = 整數(輸入(&#039;輸入一個數字: &#039;))    如果 猜測 == 數字:        印出 &#039;恭喜, 你猜對了.&#039;        運行 = 假 # 這會讓循環語句結束    假使 猜測 &lt; 數字:        印出 &#039;錯了, 數字再大一點.&#039;    否則:        印出 &#039;錯了, 數字再小一點.&#039;否則:    印出 &#039;循環語句結束&#039;印出 &#039;結束&#039;</span></code></pre><p><strong>English Python:</strong></p><pre><code><span style=""color: #3366ff;"">#!/usr/bin/env python# Fi</span><span style=""color: #3366ff;"">le name: while.twpynumber = 23running = Truewhile running:    guess = int(raw_input(&#039;Enter an integer : &#039;))    if guess == number:        print &#039;Congratulations, you guessed it.&#039;        running = False # this causes the while loop to stop    elif guess &lt; number:        print &#039;No, it is higher than that.&#039;    else:        print &#039;No, it is lower than that.&#039;else:    print &#039;The while loop is over&#039;print &#039;Done&#039;</span></code></pre><p>I think this is a great project. Certainly, programming is no longer the &#8220;walled garden&#8221; or closed loop it was when I was toying around in QBasic. Today, programmers use lot&#8217;s of different libraries, plug-in to APIs etc, and it would be almost impossible to translate all of these to Chinese, and sad to have to block yourself from anything not translated. However, to teach kids the basic principles behind programming, this would probably be extremely helpful. <a href=""http://www.iteachilearn.com/cummins/"">Jim Cummins</a>, who researches bilingual education, has argued that immigrants who receive most of their primary education in their own languages, and only a bit of training in English, actually do much better in school, and speak better English, than those who are &#8220;immersed&#8221; in English from day one.</p><p>This is because most of the process in primary school centers around learning advanced concepts and ways of thinking. If this is done in the mother tongue, the student learns much better, and is easily able to transfer this to English. I wonder if something similar would be the case here, that a student that has already learnt the logic behind programming, and learnt how to think like a programmer, would not have any problem picking up the few commands &#8220;PRINT&#8221; and &#8220;GOTO&#8221; in English. After all, what they teach you in comp sci classes is not to memorize as many class names and variables as possible (I usually have to look those up anyway), but algorithms and ways of thinking. That should be transferable.</p><p>(It would be a great research project to see if this is the case. A) If kids in China who are exposed to Chinese Python pick up programming concepts more quickly, and B) If kids who have been trained in Chinese Python are able to at a certain stage switch to English Python and catch up with a cohort that was trained in English Python from the get-go).</p><p>Stian</p><div class=""zemanta-pixie"" style=""margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;""><a class=""zemanta-pixie-a"" title=""Zemified by Zemanta"" href=""http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/2c6e5143-27e7-4fd1-876a-9b466469c97d/""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" style=""border: medium none; float: right;"" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=2c6e5143-27e7-4fd1-876a-9b466469c97d"" alt=""Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"" /></a></div>","Python chinese | Unidompus => [...] Chinese Python: &#8220;Translating a programming language&#8221; | Random &#8230;Nov 21, 2008 &#8230; Chinese Python is a complete translation of Python into Chinese.

Not only did I get some good comments on the post locally, but <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7g2mz/chinese_python_translating_a_programming_language/?sort=controversial"">it ended up</a> on <a href=""http://reddit.com"">Reddit</a>, which brought a small spike in traffic (about 300 hits in two days) and a flurry of comments over at the <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7g2mz/chinese_python_translating_a_programming_language/?sort=controversial"">Reddit page</a>. Through the comments, I was also made aware of a number of other initiatives. So I thought I&#8217;d pull in some of the most interesting comments, and also some of the new neat projects I was made aware of.</p><p><strong>Translation, fractioning of the community</strong></p><p><a href=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3073/3046267775_625c7f24cd_m.jpg""><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3073/3046267775_625c7f24cd_m.jpg"" alt="""" width=""240"" height=""180"" /></a><a href=""http://aleahmad.net/turadg"">Turadg</a> thought that it would be counter-productive to learn Python in Chinese for someone who wanted to do programming, and noted that by using Chinese identifiers but English function names (which is <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3131/"">new</a> in <a href=""http://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html"">Python 3.0</a>) one could get close to this result, he gives the example:</p><pre><code># Standard Python by a Chinese programmer#!/usr/bin/env zhpy# 檔名: while.py數字 = 23運行 = Truewhile 運行:  猜測 = int(raw_input(&#039;輸入一個數字: &#039;))  if 猜測 == 數字:    print &#039;恭喜, 你猜對了.&#039;    運行 = False # 這會讓循環語句結束  elif 猜測 &lt; 數字:    print &#039;錯了, 數字再大一點.&#039;  else:    print &#039;錯了, 數字再小一點.&#039;else:  print &#039;循環語句結束&#039;  print &#039;結束&#039;</code></pre><p>I commented back that:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;One important point is that as far as I understand, this functions as a pre-processor, &#8220;translating&#8221; the Chinese commands into English commands before compilation/running. Since there is a one-to-one correlation in this case, there isn&#8217;t any of the ambiguity or problems connected to Machine Translation. Thus, theoretically one could easily &#8220;translate&#8221; a Python program from/to Chinese.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/surajbarkale/"">sujbarkale</a> on Reddit tried using Google Translate, and got <a href=""http://xrl.us/ozqgt"">this result</a>.</p><p>Over at Reddit, much of the discussion centered around the fractioning of the global community if people started programming in Chinese Python, wasting of effort on translating libraries that could have been used on improving Python, etc. However, <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/MarkByers/"">Mark Byers</a> pointed out that &#8220;Telling people what they can and cannot do goes against the Open Source principle.

I agree with you that compatibility is key&#8230; it would be pretty odd to live in a world where you had to translate libraries to make them work (though if automated, this could be interesting&#8230;).</p><p>I also think that serious programmers would probably gravitate naturally to the English Python since it is so established.&#8221;</p><p>This was similar to my own thinking:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;What I was thinking about was to use Python to teach simple logics and ideas to kids, most of whom might not go on to program (or if they ever picked it up later, would perhaps write in Ruby or in Javascript or some fancy newfangled language anyway). In that case, I think this might be a good idea. Some people argue that programming should be an obligatory class in school by now. Not a specific language, but the idea.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Turadg also chimed in:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Thinking about it more, I&#8217;m not so sure what to expect. If you&#8217;re training people to code in Python, then I think getting them into English fastest is best. But if you&#8217;re training them in the concepts, the language doesn&#8217;t matter. So it really depends on what your learning goals are.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Oh I get where you&#8217;re coming from now. If you just want them to &#8220;the simple logics and ideas to kids&#8221; then they shouldn&#8217;t have to learn English, however little, at the same time.</p><p>I would go further though and say they shouldn&#8217;t have to learn any syntax at all. There are a number of introductory programming environments in which you create instructions by linking graphical symbols from a palette. This makes it impossible to make a syntax error and yet it is Turing-complete. The most successful such environment, to my knowledge, is the <a href=""http://www.alice.org/"" target=""_blank"">Alice</a> project from Carnegie Mellon University.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Need more research (or to locate existing one)</strong></p><p><a href=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3130/2423802887_b3c2056f84_m.jpg""><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3130/2423802887_b3c2056f84_m.jpg"" alt="""" width=""240"" height=""160"" /></a>To close that issue, I&#8217;d say that I&#8217;d really like to see some research on children learning to program using languages based in English, or in their mother tongues. Two concepts would be important, first: is there a big difference in the rapidity and quality of their learning if they are learning beginning programming with say English Python or Chinese Python (or Hebrew Python for Israeli kids, etc)? How large is this difference? Secondly: How long does it take for the students who started with Chinese or Hebrew Python to &#8220;catch up&#8221; with the ones who started out with the English version?</p><p>Perhaps the ones starting with English Python will learn roughly as rapidly as the ones starting with Chinese Python, and the group starting with Chinese Python will never be able to catch up in using the English version (because the kids using the English version are constantly improving as well - moving target). Or, perhaps the kids using the Chinese version learn the concepts much faster, and are able to translate these to English, and thus after a period of let&#8217;s say one year of using Chinese Python and two months of using English Python could be on par or ahead of students using only English Python.</p><p>(Note that if all you are looking for is to teach general logics to young kids, the second results might not matter. If you are training kids to become programmers, the second results would be the most important.)</p><p>I tried a quick Google Scholar search, but could not easily find any research related to kids learning programming through &#8220;translated&#8221; programming languages.</p><p><strong>Not just Chinese, not just Python! </strong></p><p>Finally, I was made aware that this project is far from unique - in fact there has been a lot of different attempts at &#8220;non-English programming languages&#8221;, some serious and some in jest. <a href=""http://www.algorithm.co.il/blogs/"">Lorg</a> commented on my blog and made me aware of <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hpy/0.2"">Hpy</a>, a translation of Python into Hebrew.

With one channel for each &ldquo;school&rdquo; within the university (for example <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/ignousoe"">School of education</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/ignousoss"">School of social sciences</a>, etc), more than thousand half an hour/hour long videos have been posted. (And some channels only have an introductory video, so it can be surmised that perhaps as much as double the amount will eventually be posted). These videos are from TV programs that have earlier been produced for dissemination through satellite channels and by VHS, and sometimes the quality is a bit poor, but the breadth is spectacular.I do find the IIT videos great, but this offering has me much more exciting, because it covers all fields. I have a feeling that there is a lot less culture in how to teach elementary physics, than in teaching about education, sociology and history, and for me this material is uniquely Indian and provides us a wonderful glimpse into another educational system and culture.Most of the videos are in English, which is the common language of higher education in India, but there are also substantial collections in Hindi, especially in the humanities. For me, who is learning Hindi, this is a great motivation to learn more Hindi, and probably the only place I would easily come across lecture materials on a wide range of topics in the language. Here is one example on the universalization of primary education, which we have just been learning about in class this term:<object width=""425"" height=""344"" data=""http://www.youtube.com/v/jafmwowQIJ0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true"" /><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always"" /><param name=""src"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/jafmwowQIJ0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"" /><param name=""allowfullscreen"" value=""true"" /></object>There should really be something here for everyone.

We are not talking about curriculum lists and some course PDFs, this is the entire teaching material that a student would encounter, all modules written by IGNOU staff.They are employing a T-Space repository, and offer over 16,000 documents, most from 10-50 pages long. Here is a list of the different schools, and the number of documents available:<ul><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/3632""> School of Agriculture</a> [660]</li><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/3""> School of Computer and Information Sciences</a> [741]</li><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/4""> School of Continuing Education</a> [1574]</li><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/5""> School of Education</a> [1133]</li><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/6""> School of Engineering and Technology</a> [3098]</li><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/7""> School of Health Sciences</a> [622]</li><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/8""> School of Humanities</a> [5942]</li><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/12555""> School of Journalism and New Media Studies</a> [17]</li><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/19296""> School of Law</a> [58]</li><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/9""> School of Management Studies</a> [3727]</li><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/10""> School of Sciences</a> [3579]</li><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/11""> School of Social Sciences</a> [5099]</li><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/14175""> School of Social Work </a> [582]</li><li><a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/14167""> School of Tourism and Hospitality Service Sectoral Management</a> [408]</li></ul>The richness of this documentation is astounding, and because of it&rsquo;s position both in India, and as a distance university, there are many unique collections:<ul><li>87 documents on <a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/11023"">Distance Education</a>, including an <a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/26002"">economic analysis of the China Radio and TV University</a> (50 pages), <a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/26087"">research on distance education in India</a> (30 pages), and <a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/25997"">cost effectiveness of distance education in Asia</a> (22 pages).</li><li>21 documents on <a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/2687"">Rural Development in the Indian Context</a></li><li>58 documents on <a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/19297"">Cyber Law</a></li><li>60 documents on <a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/5143"">Disaster Management</a></li><li>79 documents on <a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/18734"">HIV Family Education</a></li><li>23 documents on <a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/1700"">Indian Economic Policy</a></li><li>38 documents on <a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/972"">History of the Indian Economy</a></li><li>32 documents on <a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/1608"">Sociology in India</a></li><li>141 documents on <a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/handle/123456789/3502"">Women&rsquo;s empowerment and development</a></li></ul>&hellip;I could go on. Most of these documents are scanned PDFs that have been OCRed (you can do full-text search on them, and you can copy and paste text).As you can see, I am extremely excited about this initiative. I don&rsquo;t think I am exaggerating when I state that this is the single largest (by far) source of current open educational resources that exists (ie. not counting the out of copyright books scanned by Google and OCA). Instead of providing just a curriculum list with links to books and articles that you cannot access if you are not member of a rich university, it provides everything. And in addition, you get a wealth of material that is unique to India/Asia, etc.We often ask ourselves &ldquo;do we need every institution to produce OCW&rdquo;? Well, if we are talking about a hundred &ldquo;101 Intro to Economics&rdquo; at North-American institutions, then the answer is certainly no. But I would love to read the intro to Sociology from Nigeria, the Pedagogical survey from Hong Kong University, and the economics of small businesses from South Africa!<strong>How could this be even better?</strong><a href=""http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2007/01/24/500071/ByIndiaNewLogo1.JPG""><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"" src=""http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2007/01/24/500071/ByIndiaNewLogo1.JPG"" alt="""" width=""217"" height=""107"" /></a>Yes, it is amazing, but it is amazing 1.0. A simple act could exponentially raise the amazingness (I apologize for the lack of academic language). Currently, all this material is in scanned PDFs (luckily OCRed) sitting in a T-Space repository. A number of downloads (but far from all) require a free registration, for some reason, and a very few are not available even with that registration (almost all I clicked were available though). However, all the material is copyrighted. <em>&ldquo;Items in eGyanKosh are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved by IGNOU, unless otherwise indicated.&rdquo; </em>If instead all the material was licensed under a Creative Commons license, here&rsquo;s what we could do: Begin finding great documents, extracting the text (Ctrl+A plus copy and paste gives you the OCRed text, then you just need to edit it to make it look OK and fix typos) and importing it into a Wiki - for example <a href=""http://cnx.org"">Connexions</a>. That way, the documents would be so much more reusable. We could begin tagging them, breaking them into parts, hyperlinking between them, linking out to other content on the web, and creating an extremely rich resource for future open courses, as well as self-learners.And in the process, we might be improving the original texts, something that IGNOU themselves could benefit from. Right now, I am not sure if it&rsquo;s under Copyright because IGNOU hasn&rsquo;t considered the options, or whether they made a conscious decision to Copyright it. I would love to find out, and I hope that <a href=""http://cc-india.org"">Creative Commons India</a> could play a role here.<strong>What can we do? Use it!</strong>IGNOU has given a wonderful gift to humanity. The best way we can support them, is to talk about it, and to use it. I am sure that some <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">Peer2Peer University</a> courses will benefit extremely, but I would also love to see some of my classes assign readings from this material. I think it would be a wonderful reversal of the near one-way flow of scholarship and teaching materials (&rdquo;from the West to the Rest&rdquo;) if classes at University of Toronto used IGNOU material. Not just because it&rsquo;s free, but because it&rsquo;s very good - and relevant. I am sure that this would strengthen IGNOU&rsquo;s belief in going open (and perhaps convince them to become <a href=""http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2008/08/greengold-oa-and-gratislibre-oa.html"">open &ldquo;libre&rdquo; and not just &ldquo;gratis&rdquo;</a>), and perhaps show some Western institutions that if they don&rsquo;t want to lose the battle for mindshare completely, they also have to open up.Stian<em>Pictures by <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/"">Meanest Indian</a> @ flickr,  <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/bijoymohan/"">bijoy mohan</a> @ flickr, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/incrediblehow/"">the incredible how</a> @ flickr</em>","曾经逃课的你，今天淘课了吗？ | 开卷有益 => [...] 印度开放大学和印度理工学院也搞了开放式课程，一共发表了一万多个小时的课程视频，都是在Youtube上面（1，2）。质量经常跟美国的大学可以比，都是用英文讲的。但是中国人对这些视频感兴趣吗？可能不太感兴趣，因为他们觉得印度比中国落后，所以他们不能从印度学任何事情。我觉得这个态度很遗憾。 [...].

It&#039;s not a good feeling to suddenly see that something has been posted on your blog, without your control. When I loaded my blog, I saw that it had been entirely wiped out, and what was there instead was a brand new install of <a class=""zem_slink"" title=""WordPress"" rel=""homepage"" href=""http://wordpress.org"">WordPress</a>, with a blog called Busty, and one post saying only ""Hello World""... I had been hacked.I still am not quite sure how this happened. I am assuming it happened through some weakness in WordPress, since only my blog was affected of all the different content I host on my site, however I was running a fairly recent version of WP. In any case, the database holding all of my WP blog posts was completely hosed. I hoped in the longest that my host Site5.com would be able to restore the site from backups, but on my cheap plan, they only do one daily backup, and I discovered it too late - the backup from yesterday was already overwritten...Of course, I ought to have had a backup myself, but I had been very lax. In fact, I thought I had a backup lying around somewhere, but could not find it. So what to do? Well, after some messing around, I managed to restore almost all the old posts using a Ruby script that parsed my old blog post pages through Google Cache. It worked surprisingly well, and I will do a separate post about how I did it. The most important thing, however, is that almost all of my posts should be back in place, at the same URLs as before (if you find any broken links etc, please let me know). Most of the comments should also be preserved, because I used <a class=""zem_slink"" title=""Intense Debate"" rel=""homepage"" href=""http://www.intensedebate.com"">Intense Debate</a>.To me, it&#039;s certainly a reminder to be much more vigilant about security, and backups. It&#039;s also a neat example of how ""the cloud"" can inadvertently function as a backup. I wouldn&#039;t rely on it entirely, and it was a major pain to revert from HTML back into structured data for the database, but it&#039;s incredible that it was even possible.Happy New Year, all!Stian<div class=""zemanta-pixie"" style=""margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;""><a class=""zemanta-pixie-a"" title=""Zemified by Zemanta"" href=""http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/716b9b3a-a094-441b-874e-35d941032daf/""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" style=""border: medium none; float: right;"" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=716b9b3a-a094-441b-874e-35d941032daf"" alt=""Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"" /></a></div>","houshuang => Haha, just too late for me :) But that sounds great.

I realized that I could find most of the information through <a href=""http://www.googleguide.com/cached_pages.html"">Google </a><a rel=""wikipedia"" href=""http://www.googleguide.com/cached_pages.html"">Cache</a>, but did not look forward to the prospect of copying and pasting over 200 articles. So I thought I&#039;d try to do it in an automated fashion - and I was successful. I will describe in detail how I proceeded here, and many of these methods can be adapted for other purposes as well. I will describe how I proceeded using tools like <a href=""http://macromates.com/"">TextMate</a> (only for Mac, but similar programs exist for Windows and Linux), <a href=""http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"">Ruby</a> (all platforms) and some Unix tools (Mac and Linux have them natively, Windows can get them through <a href=""http://www.cygwin.com/"">Cygwin</a>).The first thing was downloading the information from Google. I began by doing a site search (site:reganmian.net/blog) on Google. I got several pages worth of hits, and used a wonderful plugin called <a href=""http://blog.andreineculau.com/2008/06/repagination/"">Antipagination</a> for Firefox. It allows me to right-click on the ""Next"" button at the bottom of the screen, and choose ""load all"". It will then load every single web page under each other in the same tab - it has to be seen to be believed. After all the 7 pages of Google hits (50 hits per page) had loaded, I saved the page as an html file.This html file of course has a lot of superfluous material - all we really need are the URLs to Google&#039;s cached versions of my pages. A quick way of picking out only the lines we want is to use grep, a command line tool. If we save the list of URLs to filelist.html, we can for example run <strong><em>grep reganmian.net filelist.html &gt; filelist2.html</em></strong>. This will choose only the lines that contain reganmian.net (the name of my website), and put them in the new file filelist2.html (note that you should never have the same file on both sides of the &gt; sign). If you want to exclude certain lines (for example, Google might also have listed a bunch of files ending in /trackback or /comments, or /feed, which might not be useful to you), you can also use grep -v, which only outputs the lines <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">not</span> matching the search string. (For example grep -v trackback filelist2.html &gt; filelist3.html).Now, I open filelist3.html in TextMate. TM is a great editor, with a very powerful regexp system. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regexp"">Regular expressions</a> are a very powerful way of manipulating text, but it can seem quite baffling at first. Luckily, you only need to understand a few simple ways of using them - and I find it a lot easier to do a few different regexps in TM to get what I need done, than to try to craft ""the ultimate"" Regexp that does everything at once. (This is why I also often use grep, when I just want to select certain lines).Basically, we want to isolate the cache URLs, so we have to look through the file and see what unique section comes immediate before the URL. We can then delete everything up to the URL. Go to find and replace, check ""use regexps"". Let&#039;s say that the line looks like this (very simplified):<em>Entry: Reganmian (cached) http://google.cache.com/reganmian (url) http://reganmian</em>We want the line to only contain http://google.cache.com/reganmian. First we remove the first part: search for <em><strong>^(.*)cached) </strong></em>and replace with nothing (ie. remove it). Then we remove the end: search for <em><strong>(url)(.*)$</strong></em> and again replace with nothing. ^ means the beginning of a line, and $ the end, so the first selectes everything between the beginning of the line, and the search string, etc. Holding <em>alt</em> down while selecting with the mouse also enables block-select, which is a great way of removing text, if the lines are aligned.After playing with the different tools in TextMate to ""clean up"" the text, we should have a text file only containing a list of URLs, all of which we wish to download. Then it&#039;s time for the superb tool <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"">wget</a>. It&#039;s extremely powerful, but now we will only use a small subset of the features. <em><strong>wget -i filelist3.html</strong></em> will download every single URL listed in that file.However, Google does not like ""robots"" to download files, and based on the ""<a class=""zem_slink"" title=""User agent"" rel=""wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent"">user agent</a> string"" which says ""I am wget, and I would like this file"", it will refuse all the requests. Luckily, wget knows how to lie. With this slightly longer line <em><strong>wget --user-agent=""Opera/9.25 (Windows NT 6.0; U; en)"" -i filelist3.html</strong></em>, wget will pretend to be Opera, and Google will believe it, and let us download the files. However, it&#039;s not quite over yet, because Google also becomes suspicious if you download too many files at once. In my case, it stopped me after 150 files, and called me a robot to my face. Luckily, a quick reboot of the cable modem gave me a new <a class=""zem_slink"" title=""IP address"" rel=""wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address"">IP address</a>, and I could get the last files. Another option might be to increase the delay between each file in wget&#039;s options.Now we have all the files. Unfortunately, they have horrible names based on the URLs, with all kinds of strange characters, that don&#039;t play well with other programs. I used <a href=""http://www.manytricks.com/namemangler/"">Name Mangler</a> to rename the files to 001.html, 002.html, etc. (Using Automator.app doesn&#039;t seem to work, because of all the strange characters).If we just wanted a small archive of our writings, we could stop at this point. However, we don&#039;t simply want to preserve the old pages, we want the information back into the database so that WordPress can display it dynamically, by category, by date, etc. This requires us to extract the relevant information from each page, and insert it into a WordPress database. For this, we will use Ruby.The task is actually not that difficult, although it took me a few hours, both because I program in Ruby so seldom that I often forget the syntax for different commands, and because this kind of automatic text extraction is always a bit tedious. I could have tried to insert the data directly into the WordPress database using SQL, but it is much easier to use the <a class=""zem_slink"" title=""XML-RPC"" rel=""wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC"">XML-RPC</a> interface <a href=""http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi"">metaWeblog</a> to let WordPress update its own database (the same API that offline blog clients use).Ruby has built-in support for XML-RPC, and I found some examples of using this with WordPress, but they didn&#039;t show all the options, and I spent some more time trying to figure out how to include the categories (which you have to create first on the blog), and change the posting date (so it doesn&#039;t look like they were all written today). One thing that metaWeblog doesn&#039;t seem to support, is to change the ""slug"" for a post (the short web friendly name that is a part of the URL). This was a bit important for me, because I really wanted to keep the same permalinks as before, since there are already some places out there linking to certain posts. Luckily, almost all of the permalinks were automatically generated from the title when I wrote them, and with the right date, the resulting permalink should be OK. But there are a few that I changed manually, and they will now have a different permalink.While I was experimenting with the Ruby script, I used <a href=""http://www.mamp.info/"">MAMP</a>, a neat all-in-one LAMP suite for Mac, to run WordPress locally and play with its database there. In the end, I had a script that would automatically insert every single of the blog posts into the database, when run. Here it is (it is extremely ugly, and coded to be used only once. There are probably much more elegant solutions, but it works. And maybe you can copy a snippet from it.)<pre><code>require ""xmlrpc/client""c = 0        while c &lt; 259 do # number of files  c = c + 1  text = File.read(""#{sprintf(""%03d"", c)}.html"")  begin # not all of the files are blog posts, some are     # category pages etc. If they don&#039;t fit our pattern,     # just skip them    a = text.scan(/base href\=\""http:\/\/reganmian.net\/      blog\/(.+?)\/(.+?)\/(.+?)\/(.+?)\/\""/)     year, month, day, shorttitle = a[0]     title = text.scan(/Blog Archive   \&amp;raquo\; (.*)      \&lt;\//)[0][0]    cat = text.scan(/is filed under(.*)\n/)[0][0]     categories = cat.scan(/tags\/(.+?)\//)    hour, minute = text.scan(/on (.*)at (.+?)\t/)      [0][1].split("":"")        pubdate = Time.local(year,month,day,hour,minute,0)    content = text.scan(/entrytext\""&gt;(.+?)\&lt;script/m)      [0][0].strip    server  = XMLRPC::Client.new(""reganmian.net"",       ""/blog/xmlrpc.php"")    content = { :title =&gt; title, :categories =&gt;       categories.flatten, :category =&gt; categories.flatten,       :description =&gt; content,  :dateCreated =&gt; pubdate,       :lastBuildDate =&gt; pubdate }    result  = server.call(""metaWeblog.newPost"", 1, ""admin"",     ""password"", content, true)  rescue  endend</code></pre>Not perfect, but it worked. The only problem is that the number of posts imported is slightly smaller than the one I had previously, so I will eventually have to ""hunt down"" the remaining ones, perhaps from other sources. I also tried Yahoo Cache, which gave me slightly more files, but they seemed to be poorly formatted and more difficult to use.I hope this could be useful to someone in the future. But hopefully you will not need it - backup! It was an interesting project though, and I am always amazed by the power of simple tools, as well as some of the libraries people write for Ruby. And the incredible documentation that is available out there. Hopefully this will be a modest addition.Stian<div class=""zemanta-pixie"" style=""margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;""><a class=""zemanta-pixie-a"" title=""Zemified by Zemanta"" href=""http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/98412b2e-035e-4852-b952-deb9428037fc/""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" style=""border: medium none; float: right;"" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=98412b2e-035e-4852-b952-deb9428037fc"" alt=""Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"" /></a></div>","Philip => As #11 said, Warrick is an excellent tool, but requires a bit of programming skills.

All the articles will be sent to peer-review...</em><em>The editors admit that many researchers still have a nostalgic relationship to paper. &ndash; Therefore we are publishing 25 copies on paper which we send to all the contributors in the first book in the series ""Structuring information in discourse: the explicit/implicit dimension.&rdquo; The book was edited by Bergljot Behrens and Cathrine Fabricius-Hansen.</em><em><strong>Ensures quality</strong></em><em>Our desire is to contribute to the growing family of freely available electronic publications that are distributed to the entire research world. Through the establishment of </em><em>Oslo Studies in Language we guarantee the control of both the academic content, the typographic presentation and storage for the future, without having to go through the traditional publishing houses, state Grnn and Haug. Both refer to the important power that lays with the traditional publishing houses. </em><em>&ndash; Today researchers and universities actually have to pay to have books published with international publishers. The peer-reviewers and editors are usually not paid. Then, the publishers charge good money for the journals and books. This happens, even if it is the universities and the state has has paid for the research. With this service, the researchers only have to send the content to us, before we pass it on to peer-review. If it is accepted, it will immediately be published in our electronic book series.</em>What is interesting is that this great project was the result of pressure from one of the academics involved: <em>Both give credit to a member of the editing committee, <a href=""http://www.ling.su.se/staff/oesten/index.htm"">sten Dahl</a> from <a href=""http://www.su.se"">Stockholm University</a> for sowing the seed about launching an electronic book series. &ndash; The only demand he had for joining the editing committee, was that the book series should be made available through a publishing channel that was electronic and freely available. It is said that Dahl is the most cited linguist in the Nordic countries.</em>I visited <a href=""http://www.ling.su.se/staff/oesten/index.htm"">sten Dahl</a>&#039;s homepage, and see that he has a number of his publications available in electronic format, as well <a href=""http://www.ling.su.se/staff/oesten/downloadable.htm"">two book manuscripts</a> available for download. I think is a great example of how people can push for and educate about open access in the different academic projects they are involved with. (If he really is the most cited linguist in the Nordic countries, I am sure that didn&#039;t exactly hurt either).The book series is hosted using <a href=""http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs"">Open Journal Systems</a> on a site called <a href=""https://www.journals.uio.no/"">Free Journals from University of Oslo</a>, which offers free hosting for peer-reviewed journals at the University of Oslo that are starting up as OA journals, or older TA journals that would like to convert to OA.

That fall, I also participated in David Wiley&rsquo;s online course <a href=""http://www.opencontent.org/wiki/index.php?title=Intro_Open_Ed_Syllabus"" target=""_blank"">Intro to Open Education</a>), which turned out embody many of the ideas we had discussed, and was a very powerful learning experience for me.</em><em>The concept was very simple - a wiki where people sign up, no pre-requisites, but you have to work hard. 150 pages of (open access) readings a week, and a few reflection questions. The first week, we read a bunch of long UN reports, and the question was &ldquo;Should universal education be a universal human right? And if so, is it enough that it is a right, or should it be an obligation as well?&rdquo;. We then all blogged about this (and you can still read my contribution at <a href=""../2007/08/31/opened-week-1/"" target=""_blank"">OpenEd Week 1</a>), read each others blogs, commented, etc. A very simple format, but because I was highly motivated to see it through (I often spent an entire Sunday on this course, even though I was very busy with courses in my last year of undergrad, and didn&rsquo;t get any formal credit for it), I learnt a lot.</em><em>After the course was over, a few others picked up on the idea (I&rsquo;ve posted on them at <a href=""../2008/07/20/is-your-course-schedule-full-yet/"" target=""_blank"">Is Your Course Schedule Full Yet?</a>), building on the model and adding some minor variations to improve it. Finally, Leigh Blackall came up with the term &ldquo;Wiley wikis&rdquo; to describe this kind of courses.</em><em>I personally had an interest in doing more research on this form of courses to see how they could be further improved, what were the factors in their success or failure, how good were individual learning outcomes, and what factors influenced this, etc. In addition, we wanted to provide a platform where many more such courses could be launched (and about other topics - incidentally, almost all the early courses seemed to be about education and technology itself). So far, the courses had been launched by a few individuals who were all tech-savvy and very hooked in to the open education movement, and perhaps even had more leeway within their institutes because of they were studying open education, etc. We wanted to &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; the model, so that many more professors (and others) could step up and teach courses, and to have a platform where we could experiment with forms of peer-learning, and eventually perhaps ways of obtaining accreditation, etc.</em>Stian<div class=""zemanta-pixie"" style=""margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;""><a class=""zemanta-pixie-a"" title=""Zemified by Zemanta"" href=""http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/b345fa72-0b11-4dce-a26f-4d9628f5d97e/""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" style=""border: medium none; float: right;"" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=b345fa72-0b11-4dce-a26f-4d9628f5d97e"" alt=""Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"" /></a></div>",Article about Indonesian reading gardens in IFLA newsletter,"asia,books,development,libraries,open access,personal,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/01/18/article-about-indonesian-reading-gardens-in-ifla-newsletter/,"<img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"" src=""http://lh6.ggpht.com/_0zhFe8pB7to/R7OsXsX8-DI/AAAAAAAABUk/qOtG07gc5tg/s288/P2120072.JPG"" alt="""" width=""288"" height=""216"" />The article below was written for the <a href=""http://www.ifla.org/VII/s10/index.htm"">IFLA Section of Libraries for Children and Young Adults Newsletter</a>, <a href=""http://www.ifla.org/VII/s10/pubs/s10-newsletter-December08.pdf"">December 2008</a> (just published), edited by Singaporean librarian <a href=""http://ramblinglibrarian.blogspot.com/"">Ivan Chew</a>, whose blog I have been reading for a long time, and whom I was lucky enough to meet in Singapore in 2007, while getting a new visa for my stay in Indonesia.

We followed our host Agus Munawar among the houses, and to our goal: the reading garden. Around fifty small boys and girls were sitting scattered on the floor of a pendopo (kind of open balcony), reading in deep concentration. Some sat by themselves, engrossed in a text, others were in pairs or small groups, with one child reading aloud for the others. When they had finished their books, they went into the small adjacent covered room, and chose another book from the racks.This was Sunday - reading day - and they had started the day by doing physical exercise together. After we arrived, different children took the microphone and read confidently aloud from their chosen material. Hours away from the nearest public library, or even the nearest book store, this local citizen&#039;s initiative was helping children acquire a love of reading and learning, which would probably help them not only do much better in school, but also grow up as better informed and more active citizens.As unlikely as the scene in the little remote village might seem, it is far from an isolated example. After the fall of Suharto in 1998, and the end of the Orde Baru (new order) regime, which strictly limited freedom of speech and associations, a growing movement of taman bacaan (an Indonesian term which means reading garden, pronounced taman batsha&#039;an) has appeared, which tries to provide access to information, and above all foster a love of reading and knowledge among the younger generations.<em>Background</em>Dauzan Farook was one of the pioneers of the modern literacy movements in Indonesia. When he retired, he decided to dedicate the rest of his life to spreading knowledge and reading to the citizens of Yogyakarta.He spent his pension of roughly 50$ per month, and all the savings he had left, on building up a library of books and magazines. He then walked around for hours each day, approaching people and asking if they wanted to borrow his material. He would lend children&#039;s books to children, and books on economics to business men. When he passed away in 2007, he was 83 years old and had amassed more than 10,000 books and 4,000 magazines in his apartment. He helped inspire a movement, and many activists today still talk about the legacy that he left behind.<em>The fall of Suharto</em>But the big change began in 1998, when Suharto&#039;s regime fell. This unleashed the pent-up energy of all kinds of organizations that had been repressed and had their activities limited during the Orde Baru; youth, social and even religious organizations. In addition to their newfound freedom, they were met by a society still slowly recovering from the devastating financial crisis that had begun in 1996, and had caused many children to drop out of school for failure to pay the school fees, and some even became street children. There was thus a strong drive from many different kinds of communities to come together and provide social services, and it is also not strange that one important focus of these social services would be to provide education and access to information.The new grassroots literacy movement that centered on reading gardens probably began in Bandung, an educational hub a few hours west of Jakarta. Early known for its many sub-cultures, an ecosystem of ""do-it-yourself"" (DIY) philosophy had developed around the punk-rock scene, with small shops selling fan products that were home-produced, posters and t-shirts, and the gradual development of hundreds of independent clothing retailers that sold fashion through local independent shops. It was in this fertile environment of initiative and spirit of nyeleneh - kumaha aing (uniqueness and DIY) that students and artists came together with activists to form the first komunitas literer (literary communities), based around alternative bookstores as activity hubs.<em>Networks</em>Different kinds of networks played a key role in spreading the idea, and helping people start reading gardens all over Indonesia. In Bandung and Yogyakarta there were forums where owners of community libraries could meet and share experiences. Rumah Dunia, a reading garden started by the well-known author Gola Gong from the proceeds of his book royalties became known as a ""best-case"" reading garden, with many visitors who came to learn about its intensive programming of literacy activities, amateur theatre, and training in writing and critical journalism. Perhaps most important was the 1001 Books network which provided both a forum for sharing experience, but more importantly, access to sharing of resources.The 1001 Books network collects and distributes children&#039;s books to more than a hundred different reading gardens. Internet is an important enabler, as it makes possible the coordination and recruitment of hundreds of volunteers. Through their mailing list, reading garden operators are also connected and can exchange experiences. They pick up donations at people&#039;s homes, collect books in residential areas and public places like malls, and have a network of book-drop boxes in strategic places, like supermarkets, to make it easy and convenient to contribute.<em>Current status</em>There are roughly three &ldquo;reading garden&rdquo; models operating in Indonesia today. The government founded thousands of village reading gardens in the 1990&rsquo;s, which mostly fell into disarray, and has recently again began to provide one-time seed money for around 2000 reading gardens. Most of this seems to go to book depositories connected with schools and government institutions. There are a number of Indonesian companies that have sponsored reading gardens, as part of Corporate Social Responsability, for examples Ria Pulp which sponsored over hundred readings gardens in the island of Riau. However, what is perhaps most interesting is the reading gardens set up by individuals and local community organizations, which number several hundred in Jakarta alone. A common theme for these is their strong focus on becoming more than a gudang buku (place to store books), and there are often activities scheduled the entire week, emphasizing reading, writing, drawing, acting, and journalism.Stian","plantesjardinsnature => an indonesian reading garden? i can only imagine, looks so peaceful and  relaxing.

At that time, I was still an undergraduate, and barely knew anyone in the field &ndash; and her reception was a wonderful and inspiring welcome.From I first began to understand the development of the OER and OCW movements through <a href=""http://davidwiley.org/"">David Wiley</a>&#039;s <a href=""http://opencontent.org/wiki/index.php?title=Intro_Open_Ed_Syllabus"">Open Ed course</a>, I was struck by the incedible deftness through which the Hewlett Foundation had basically ""constructed a brand new field"". I don&#039;t want to say that there were not many other organizations and institutions contributing, nor that the idea of open education was brand new (go back and read <a href=""http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Illich/Deschooling/intro.html"">Illich</a>), but there seems to be no doubt that Hewlett has played a huge role. By strategic investments in a number of projects, and by pushing these to collaborate and create synergies, first in the US, and rapidly also internationally, they achieved what I believe is every charitable funding organizations wet dream: To put a limited amount of resources in just the right place, at just the right time, and create something that is valuable, sustainable, and growing.Now, Cathy <a href=""http://carnegiefoundation.org/news/sub.asp?key=51&amp;subkey=2855"">is moving</a> to the <a href=""http://carnegiefoundation.org/"">Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a>, to head Carnegie&#039;s new strategic work in open education.

The presentation is based on the preliminary research I am doing for my MA thesis, which will be on open educational resources in China. In China, there are roughly two categories of OERs - one is the Chinese translations of MIT and other foreign universities&#039; OCW materials - mostly facilitated by <a href=""http://www.core.org.cn/core/default.aspx"">CORE</a> and <a href=""http://myoops.org/"">OOPS</a>. In addition, the Chinese Ministry of Education is funding a large-scale production of Chinese OER (many thousand courses produced and available already), called China Quality OCW (Chinese: 精品课程).This is a huge project involving 650 different universities, and there has also been a lot written and researched around this - thousands of peer-reviewed papers. It&#039;s very difficult as an outsider to make any sense of this research quickly, so I am getting research help from a Chinese professor in distance education. The presentation will include an introduction to the Chinese OER project (which most people in North America are not very familiar with), and a demonstration of some of the resources, as well as a presentation of some of the research on OER going on in China. Here&#039;s the abstract that was accepted for a 45 minute session:<strong>Global Concept, Local Practices: State of the Research onOCW in Chinese</strong><em>Since the MIT OCW program was started in 2002, the OCW movement and idea have spread to many different countries and linguistic contexts.

For the OCW and OER movements to progress, it is imperative that we be able to learn from each other, and bridge these linguistic barriers.</em><em>China has been one of the most aggressive adopters of the OCW idea. Not only is China Open Resources for Education (CORE) coordinating efforts to translate MIT OCW into Chinese, but the Chinese Ministry of Education has since 2003 been operating a national OCW program called China Quality OpenCourseWare (精品课程). Chinese universities submit proposals, and can receive between $7,300 and $14,600 per course that is made freely available online. By 2007, there were already over 1,100 courses available online, many of these with extensive resources, and video recordings. </em><em>In addition to this large-scale production OCW, the Chinese scholarly community has also been prolific in researching and publishing about the program. The China Academic Journals database, which provides the full text of over 7,000 Chinese scholarly articles, lists 2,137 articles with the term 精品课程 (China Quality OCW), of which 421 were published in 2008. In numbers, this is roughly equivalent to all the scholarly publication that mention OCW in English and other Latin languages in total - however, the story becomes even more impressive when initial sampling shows that most of the Chinese articles listed mention OCW in their title, and have OCW as their main topic, whereas many of the English language publications are writing about broader issues, and only refer to OCW in passing.</em><em>I am currently conducting a research project on this wealth of literature. Initially I will try to provide a broad grouping of the Chinese articles on OCW, provide statistics on number of articles in each group (for example: articles that describe the process of producing individual OCW courses, articles that present surveys on student usage, etc), and in what kind of journals these articles appear. My ultimate objective is not only to gain a good understanding of the state of research around the Chinese Quality OCW program, but also identify specific journal articles that provide theoretical models, methodological approaches or accounts of experiences that are very relevant and useful to the North-American research on OER and OCW. </em><em>In my presentation, I will give a brief overview of the history and current state of China Quality OpenCourseWare, how it is funded, produced, and used, and also how it interacts with the Chinese translations of for example MIT OCW. I will give an overview over the ""state of research"", both in terms of poignant research questions, methodologies and also relevant findings, from the Chinese context. I will also argue for a more integrated research roadmap for OCWs in North America, that actively engages with researchers and the literature from around the world. </em>Very ambitious, and my research is still in its early stages, but I think it will still be interesting, and invite people at the conference to attend.I might try to record it as well.Stian<div class=""zemanta-pixie"" style=""margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;""><a class=""zemanta-pixie-a"" title=""Zemified by Zemanta"" href=""http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/db308a1f-509a-4caa-b534-999ee3264757/""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" style=""border: medium none; float: right;"" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=db308a1f-509a-4caa-b534-999ee3264757"" alt=""Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"" /></a></div>","Slideshare has great customer support | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] especially excited about putting my recent presentation from the Connexions/OCWC Conference online (abstract, slidecast) because this was on a fairly specialized topic about which almost no information is [...].

It&#039;s a huge event, with something like 3.000+ attendees, including a very hefty component from OISE, both professors and graduate students. It was great going there only as a participant, and getting the feel for the place. I remember feeling a bit silly though, because everyone that saw my name tag which said ""University of Toronto"", naturally assumed I was at Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (UofT&#039;s faculty of education), but all I could reply was ""no, I&#039;m an undergraduate, but I&#039;ve applied""... Very wannabe. This year, I am a bona-fide OISE student, luckily.Looking at the program, there are a lot of very interesting sessions that I am looking forward to. It will also be more fun to go this year, because I already begin to recognize different theoretical debates, the ""big names"" in the field, etc. For example, it will be fun to see Jrgen Schriewer duck it out with Ramirez and Meyer, after reading so much about their different conceptions of globalization of education.I submitted an abstract based on a paper I did for a class on global governance and educational change, where I tried to apply different theories to explain why the idea of OpenCourseWare spread to some countries, and not to others. Here is the abstract:<strong>One size does not fit all: A case study of the spread of OpenCourseWare to India, China and Japan.</strong><em>Since its inception in 2002, OpenCourseWare (OCW), a movement to post university courses online under open licenses, has spread around the world. Initially proposed by MIT President Charles Vest, and supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, this concept has spread to universities in more than 30 countries in less than six years. In many cases they have created local and regional consortia, and in some cases it is supported by the local government. How is such a rapid dissemination possible, and what does it mean for internationalization of higher education? </em><em>This paper will consist of a case study of three Asian countries that produce OCWs. Japan&rsquo;s initiative was set up through personal connections between MIT and Japanese universities, and is independent of the state. India&rsquo;s program is not a formal member of the consortium, and consists of the national open university, and the Indian Institutes of Technology. China&rsquo;s Ministry of Education has financially supported the creation of over 10,000 open courses. I will apply Mintrom&rsquo;s theory of policy entrepreneurs and innovation diffusion to analyze the spread of this movement, and use the three cases to discuss whether OCW is a case of Ramirez and Meyer&rsquo;s &ldquo;global institutionalism&rdquo;.</em>Stian<div class=""zemanta-pixie"" style=""margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;""><a class=""zemanta-pixie-a"" title=""Zemified by Zemanta"" href=""http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/b9b85ddd-4081-4d73-a423-1c7c4aaa9cfc/""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" style=""border: medium none; float: right;"" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=b9b85ddd-4081-4d73-a423-1c7c4aaa9cfc"" alt=""Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"" /></a></div>","BRAYDEN => This is my first visit here, thanks.

The <a href=""https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/ocs-2.0.0-1/index.php/oise/"">Dean&#039;s Graduate Conference</a> at <a href=""http://www.oise.utoronto.ca"">OISE</a> is an annual event where graduate students get to present on their on-going research to their peers and people from the community who are interested. This year, we put together a panel on OER, and there will be two other speakers besides me. Hopefully this can begin to raise the status of OER at our school, both as an activity, but also as something that can be researched. Below is my abstract (the conference is in the beginning of May in Toronto).<strong>A theoretical approach to accreditation of Open Education</strong><em>It has always been possible to gain advanced learning outside of the formal academy, through libraries and book-clubs for example, but the open-education movement has radically increased the feasibility of informal learning. Through the proliferation of open-access journals, open-educational resources (such as MIT OpenCourseWare), collaborative authoring such as Connexions and WikiEducator, and peer-to-peer learning systems such as Peer2PeerUniversity and Wikiversity, determined students with internet access can achieve learning outcomes similar to university courses.How can such knowledge be accredited and proven? Some of the possibilities currently being explored range from the traditional methods of challenge exams and competency-based accreditation institutions, to attempts at applying peer-based accreditation from the open source world, and portfolios. However, these attempts need to be informed by sociological theories of schooling and accreditation, and I will use human capital theory and credentialism to analyze accreditation of open education.</em>Stian<div class=""zemanta-pixie"" style=""margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;""><a class=""zemanta-pixie-a"" title=""Zemified by Zemanta"" href=""http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/8a70c042-14e5-4dbc-89be-afa1685c5e7c/""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" style=""border: medium none; float: right;"" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=8a70c042-14e5-4dbc-89be-afa1685c5e7c"" alt=""Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"" /></a></div>",Heartburn Home Remedy => The topic is quite trendy on the Internet right now.

I had to experiment with a few different ways, but finally I found that you have to generate a Mobipocket file. For Mac, you can use the excellent <a href=""http://www.lexcycle.com/"">Stanza</a> to do this (I understand there are programs for Windows too, not sure about Linux, but hopefully there are options).A small bug, it seems, in Stanza is that if you copy text from for example a webpage (many Chinese novels are available in full-text as one long webpage), and choose ""Create new from clipboard"" in Stanza, the linefeeds disappear. And for some reason, if I save the text in Textmate or TextEdit as UTF8 text, or even RTF, it doesn&#039;t work, and the text becomes all garbled. However, if I copy the text into OpenOffice, or Word, and either save the file as .doc and open it in Stanza, or copy again from this program to Stanza, it works - with the linefeeds and paragraphs preserved.So to summarize, copy from a webpage to OpenOffice, and then from OpenOffice to Stanza. Generate MobiPocket file, and drag it over to the ebook reader. Voil, pure Chinese ebook goodness!(This is using Stanza 1.0.0-beta16 - they might fix the loss of linefeeds in a subsequent update. Also, I hope Bokeen comes out with a new firmware update that enables you to read simple unicode txt or rtf files directly).Stian<div class=""zemanta-pixie"" style=""margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;""><a class=""zemanta-pixie-a"" title=""Zemified by Zemanta"" href=""http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/b61853d1-0f4c-4350-b564-06795476939b/""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" style=""border: medium none; float: right;"" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=b61853d1-0f4c-4350-b564-06795476939b"" alt=""Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"" /></a></div>","Marlon => Thats great material, like your stuff, just passing to say hi!.

As populations have become more diverse around the world, public libraries have risen to the challenge, and whether you visit the <a href=""http://www.deichmanske-bibliotek.oslo.kommune.no/english/"">Public Library in Oslo</a>, or in <a href=""http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/"">Toronto</a>, they have wonderful collections of children and adult books (and often films, DVDs, magazines and newspapers as well) in a wide variety of languages. In Toronto it&#039;s fun going ""branch shopping"", since the library has something like 99 branches, and each branch tailors its material to the local population - thus you can see many Indian languages at the Gerrard branch, and Polish and Serbian at the Roncesvalles branch.However, the big chain bookstores in Canada are anglo-only. If you visit a Chapters (pretty much the only chain bookstore in Canada), and ask for books in other languages, they&#039;ll show you the dictionary section. They don&#039;t have anything in French (in Toronto at least, maybe in Ottawa it&#039;s different), nor in Spanish or Chinese. Certainly, in the various Chinatowns there are great Chinese-language bookstores, but I always wondered - if you are successful Chinese lawyer living in a nice house in the suburbs, why is it that you have to drive downtown to Spadina (or to the huge Chinese mall in North York) to pick up the latest Hong Kong novel? Why can&#039;t you do it while taking your kids to a movie at the mall?I&#039;ve also noticed that US bookstores tend to carry more and more materials in Spanish. Of course, the Latinos in the US probably make up a bigger percentage as a single linguistic group (especially in the south) than any group does in for example Toronto (even the Chinese). In addition, at least for the Chinese, a lot of the second-generation kids cannot read Chinese, and there&#039;s the added complication of traditional vs. simplified characters. But still. Canada keeps thinking of itself as the fruit bowl and the US as the melting pot, but I wonder. As I&#039;ve <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2007/12/18/completely-non-representative-reflections-on-new-york/"">written about before</a>, I found people much more confidently speaking different languages in New York than Toronto (anecdotally).<img class=""alignleft"" src=""http://www.piedepagina.com/numero9/imagenes/portada_codigo.jpg"" alt="""" width=""246"" height=""387"" />All this to say that I came across an interesting piece on books translated into English through Ethan Zuckerman&#039;s <a href=""http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/"">always excellent blog</a>. It contains some very interesting news about the rise of Spanish publishing within the US, including the fact that <em>El Cdigo Da Vinci</em> (<em><a class=""zem_slink"" title=""The Da Vinci Code"" rel=""amazon"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/Da-Vinci-Code-Dan-Brown/dp/0385504209%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0385504209"">The Da Vinci Code</a></em> by Dan Brown in Spanish) sold 300,000 copies. Here&#039;s an excerpt from the paper:<em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Bilingual Publishing Trend in the US</span>Spanish is the second most commonly used language in the US after English. According to the 2006 American Community Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau, Spanish is the primary language spoken at home by over 34 million people aged five or older. The US is home to more than 40 million Hispanics, making it the world&rsquo;s fifth-largest Spanish-speaking community after Mexico, Colombia, Spain and Argentina.</em><em>A little over a decade ago, Spanish-language books occupied the smallest slice of shelf space at bookstores around the country. But the 2000 census and its revelations about the fast-growing Hispanic population sparked renewed interest among US publishing houses in meeting the reading wishes of Spanish speakers. Then came Dan Brown&rsquo;s <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Da Vinci Code</span>, which not only shot up the international charts but quickly became one of the best-selling translations into Spanish of all time. While successful Spanish-language titles in the US typically sell between 15,000 and 20,000 copies, more than 300,000 copies of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">El Cdigo Da Vinci</span> were scooped off bookstore shelves across the land, ushering in what some described as a new era for Spanish-language books in America.</em><em>Now publishers are starting to time the release of English and Spanish versions so they coincide. Best-selling translations have helped the book market overall by alerting readers to the broadening selection of Spanish titles available at their local bookstores.</em><em>That was when several major US publishers began establishing divisions to cultivate new Hispanic talent and focus on the sale of both Spanish-language books and English books geared for the Hispanic market. About that time, large chain booksellers began hiring Spanish book-buyers to study market demographics and expand their <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Libros en Espaol</span> sections. Publishers from Spain were for many years the only players serving the Hispanic market. But now they are competing with US houses for new authors and translation rights.</em>The author goes on to say that perhaps the rise of e-book readers (which I have been experimenting with lately, with excellent results) will enable publishers to sell directly to customers abroad, for example Spanish and Latin-American publishers could set up websites marketed directly to the diasporas in the US. I personally would love to buy Chinese and Indonesian novels online, if they were in an open format (no DRM), and I could easily pay a reasonable price.Stian","Spanish-Language Publishing => [...] weblogRandom Stuff that Matters posted in their articleLarge market for Spanish-language books in the US, aboutthe bilingual publishing trend in the U.S., that &#8220;the 2000 census and its [...].

This way people can hear you speak and see the slides change at the appropriate points, without you having to compile it all into a large video file.</p><p><b><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net"" mce_href=""http://www.slideshare.net""><img class=""alignleft"" src=""http://public.slideshare.net/images/redesign/slideshare.gif"" mce_src=""http://public.slideshare.net/images/redesign/slideshare.gif"" alt="""" height=""50"" width=""200""></a></b>It&#039;s also getting easier and easier to produce an audio file - I normally just turn on <a class=""zem_slink"" title=""Audacity"" rel=""homepage"" href=""http://audacity.sourceforge.net/"" mce_href=""http://audacity.sourceforge.net/"">Audacity</a> on my laptop before I start speaking. The sound becomes a bit noisy, but with the remove noise feature in Audacity, the end-result is surprisingly good. I&#039;ve put several presentations up, but my first slidecast was <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/08/14/talk-at-iipa-in-delhi-on-open-research-oer-and-open-learning-in-developing-countries-slidecast/"" mce_href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/08/14/talk-at-iipa-in-delhi-on-open-research-oer-and-open-learning-in-developing-countries-slidecast/"">my presentation on open research and open education</a> which I gave this summer in New Delhi. That presentation vividly illustrates how with a little bit of extra work, your presentation can have a much wider reach. The presentation was given at the <a href=""http://www.iipa.ernet.in/"" mce_href=""http://www.iipa.ernet.in/"">Indian Institute of Public Administration</a>, which is where top bureaucrats go to get mid-career training, and I spoke to a group of 25 professors. It was a real honor to be invited, and they had some interesting questions after the talk. However, by putting <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/open-research-open-educational-resources-and-open-learning-presentation-at-iipa-delhi-554807"" mce_href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/open-research-open-educational-resources-and-open-learning-presentation-at-iipa-delhi-554807"">the slidecast</a> up on Slideshare, I was able to share it with the world.</p><p>During the last half year, that slidecast received almost 1.500 hits, and I know that a number of people saw it, and that it benefitted me. For example, I would probably not be giving a <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/01/25/upcoming-presentation-open-education-around-the-world/"" mce_href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/01/25/upcoming-presentation-open-education-around-the-world/"">presentation on open education</a> at the Education Commons at OISE, if the people working there hadn&#039;t seen this earlier presentation and decided that although I was a first year MA student, I knew how to present. This can be especially important for students and beginning academics who don&#039;t have a lot of formal publications. But even if you do - knowing how to write, and knowing how to present are two different skills.</p><p><b>Problems, and good customer support<br></b>I was especially excited about putting my recent presentation from the Connexions/OCWC Conference online (<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/01/25/global-concept-local-practices-state-of-the-research-on-ocw-in-chinese/"" mce_href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/01/25/global-concept-local-practices-state-of-the-research-on-ocw-in-chinese/"">abstract</a>, <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/02/12/presentation-on-opencourseware-in-china-posted-to-slideshare/"" mce_href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/02/12/presentation-on-opencourseware-in-china-posted-to-slideshare/"">slidecast</a>) because this was on a fairly specialized topic about which almost no information is available in English. Whereas the previous presentation was a general overview of OER and open research, which would not be very interesting to people already inside the movement, this presentation was ""cutting edge"" research. Not that many people attended my presentation in Houston, because there were competing tracks (I was competing with David Wiley, no less), but several already told me that they were interested.</p><p>However, when trying to set the timings of the Slidecast, I ran into problems. It seemed like save did not work, and the timings did not show up. I tried a variety of different things, like reuploading it in a different format, but I could not get it to work. I looked around to see if there was another webservice that could let me do the same, but I couldn&#039;t easily find one. My other option would have been to turn it into a ""movie"", but that seemed like a waste. Even Keynote, which supports creating Flash-movies with narration, doesn&#039;t let you do it with an existing MP3, you have to record from scratch.</p><p>So I finally sent off an email to the support desk at Slideshare.net, not expecting much. After all, I was not a paying customer, and I wasn&#039;t expecting much of an answer. I was positively surprised when I received an email back, quite soon after, suggesting that I delete cookies and temporary files. I did, and it had no effect. Back to Slideshare. It actually took us a while to figure out what was going on, in total my GMail conversation thread shows that 18 messages went back and forth during 24 hours. The wonderful part was that on the other end was a high-level technician who treated me as a valued collaborator in hunting down this bug. I sent screenshots, tried different techniques, and at one point even used Firebug to look at the XML files sent to my browser. Finally we nailed it, there had been some bug in importing my specific presentation, and the thing was fixed.</p><p>In this age of calling customer support and being told by someone to ""reboot your computer"", it is wonderful to be dealing with someone who has a deep understanding of how their system works, and who treats you as an intelligent person. Thank you very much to Ashwan, and anyone else who were involved.</p><p>(And the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/02/12/presentation-on-opencourseware-in-china-posted-to-slideshare/"" mce_href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/02/12/presentation-on-opencourseware-in-china-posted-to-slideshare/"">slidecast is now available</a>!)</p><p><b>Suggestion<br></b>One thing that I would love to see is more detailed analytical data. I know that 1.500 people have visited my presentation, but how many of them actually watched it, and how many clicked on a link, saw the first slide, and left? Youtube has quite detailed analytics about when in a movie people stop watching, etc. We wouldn&#039;t need something that fancy, but perhaps ""350 people watched at least half the slides in your presentation"", or ""400 people spent more than 10 minutes on your presentation"". Since Slideshare serves up each slide as people move along (I&#039;m assuming), they should be able to tell with a good enough accuracy.<br></p><p>Stian</p>",Ashwan => Thanks for the kind words! I personally think that slidecasting is one of the under-utilised features of SlideShare and anything I can do to get more people to use it would be awesome! :). "Release early, release often: English-Chinese dictionary based on Wikipedia","china,languages,open access,personal,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/02/16/release-early-release-often-english-chinese-dictionary-based-on-wikipedia/,"<strong>Background</strong>Although there are some great Chinese dictionaries out there, I often encounter cases when they are not enough. I might either be looking for a specific concept, like ""open access"" (in scholarly publishing) and want to know how that is written in Chinese, so that I can google for articles about it in Chinese. Or I might want to know how Heidegger, Copenhagen or Grey&#039;s Anatomy is written in Chinese - a dictionary is unlikely to have any of these (it might have the two first, if it is very complete, but certainly not the last).Wikipedia is a great, perhaps unintentional, source of these words, because of interwiki links. Each article (usually) has a number of links to articles on the same topic in another language. In the wiki markup, these look like [[en:Oslo]] (to make a link to the English article about Oslo), and they are listed on the bottom left side of the screen. When, a few days ago, I needed to know about open access in Chinese, I went to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_(publishing)"">English page on open access</a>, and clicked on the Chinese link, to the page <a href=""http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BC%80%E6%94%BE%E8%8E%B7%E5%8F%96"">开放获取</a>.<strong>Data extraction</strong>One of the neat things about Wikipedia is that you can download the whole database, and do fun things with the contents. In fact, I tried doing this all the way back in 2007, which gave good results, but I never did anything further (and didn&#039;t write it up, since I was in Indonesia, and not blogging, at the time). Recently, a friend of mine has been playing around with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dict"">dictd</a> servers and files, and this inspired me to take up what I had left.Luckily, I had pasted the little code snippet I made back then into an email to my friend, and I could find it easily. It worked without any modifications. All I had to do was download the latest Chinese database, an XML file containing all the articles (the file <a href=""http://download.wikimedia.org/zhwiki/20090116/zhwiki-20090116-pages-articles.xml.bz2"">zhwiki-20090116-pages-articles.xml.bz2</a> in this <a href=""http://download.wikimedia.org/zhwiki/20090116/"">directory</a>; you can find all the different databases at <a href=""http://download.wikipedia.org"">Wikipedia Downloads</a>). I then ran the Ruby script below, to extract all the titles of articles, and their interwiki links, to a separate, tab-separated text file:<pre><code>zh = File.open(""zhwiki-20090116-pages-articles.xml"")zhtitle = File.open(""english-chinese.txt"",""w"")title, entitle, hitcounter, counter = &#039;&#039;,&#039;&#039;,0,0while true  counter += 1  if zh.readline.match(/\(.*?)\&lt;\/title&gt;/)    title = Regexp::last_match[1]  end  if line.match(/\[\[en:(.*?)\]\]/)    entitle =  Regexp::last_match[1]    unless title.match(/^Wikipedia|^User|^Help|^[A-Za-z]/i)      zhtitle &lt;&lt; title &lt;&lt; ""\t"" &lt;&lt; entitle &lt;&lt; ""\n""      hitcounter += 1      if hitcounter == (hitcounter / 100) * 100        puts ""In #{counter} articles, found #{hitcounter}</code><code>hits: </code><code>#{hitcounter.to_f/counter.to_f*100}%.""      end    end  endend</code></pre>This generates an output file that looks like this<table border=""0""><tbody><tr><td>设计模式</td><td>Design pattern</td></tr><tr><td>中华人民共和国</td><td>People&#039;s Republic of China</td></tr><tr><td>克利斯登奈加特</td><td>Kristen Nygaard</td></tr><tr><td>黑客</td><td>Hacker (computing)</td></tr><tr><td>林纳斯托瓦兹</td><td>Linus Torvalds</td></tr><tr><td>理查德斯托曼</td><td>Richard Stallman</td></tr><tr><td>自由软件基金会</td><td>Free Software Foundation</td></tr><tr><td>2003年7月</td><td>July 2003</td></tr><tr><td>操作系统</td><td>Operating system</td></tr></tbody></table>It&#039;s interesting to compare the statistics for this run, and for the run I did in March, 2007. In 2007, the XML dump was 520MB, with 59,600 hits (articles with interwiki links to English). In 2009, the XML dump is 1.1GB, with around 123,300 hits, ie. roughly double both the filesize and hits in two years. As you can see from the small selection above, not all of these are useful (dates, for example), but many are, and would not be found in ordinary dictionaries.<strong>Transforming to simplified and traditional characters</strong>The Chinese Wikipedia contains articles written in both simplified and traditional characters, and has a built-in facility to convert this on the fly, so that a user can read everything in simplified or traditional according to the settings. Converting from simplified to traditional and back is not trivial, because there are a number of traditional characters that all convert to the same simplified character, etc. Chinese Wikipedia has come up with a great conversion database which deals with this, and once again, we are able to download it and use it for our own purposes.Back in 2007, a friend of mine downloaded this database, and converted it to a sed script. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed"">Sed</a> is an extremely fast command line <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regexp"">regexp</a> search-and-replace program for *NIX (also built into OSX). The file looks like this:s/幾畫/几画/gs/賣畫/卖画/gs/滷鹼/卤碱/gs/原畫/原画/geach line is an instruction to do global search and replace on for example 幾畫 (traditional) with 几画 (simplified). This is from the traditional-&gt;simplified file, there is also a simplified-&gt;traditional file. Note that sometimes the conversion isn&#039;t simply between characters, but also between words, when different words are used in mainland China and Taiwan. (Download <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/cntw"">cn-&gt;tw</a> and <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/twcn"">tw-&gt;cn</a> sed files).So instead of having a file that mixed simplified and traditional characters, we can easily generate one with simplified and one with traditional, using sed:<pre>sed -f cntw english-chinese.txt &gt; english-chinese.tw.txtsed -f twcn english-chinese.txt &gt; english-chinese.cn.txt</pre>Instead of doing all this yourself, you can directly download the entire textfile in <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/english-chinese.cn.zip"">simplified</a>, or <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/english-chinese.tw.zip"">traditional characters</a> (or <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/english-chinese.zip"">both</a>, zipped).<strong>Using the file</strong>With this simple file, you can already do a lot. The simplest is to use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep"">grep</a>, a fast command line tool that searches lines in a text file. To quickly search for open access, I would use<pre>grep -i ""open access"" english-chinese.cn.txt</pre>and get the following result:开放获取 Open accessthe <em>-i</em> means that grep ignores case differences. Note that on my Mac, I cannot see Chinese characters in the terminal window (it might be possible to fix with some settings). An alternative would be to do<pre>grep -i ""open access"" english-chinese.cn.txt &gt; out.tmp</pre>and then open out.tmp in a text editor that can read UTF8 (unicode). Note that in many text editors you have to specifically ask to open the file as UTF8.This is cumbersome, but you can of course make different kinds of interfaces to it.<strong>Web interface</strong>One simple interface I made was a web interface. Initially I simply ran the <em>grep</em> command through a Ruby wrapper, but I realized that if I executed arbitrary text on the command line, people could use it to infiltrate my server, so I changed to a very simple search. Note that this is not indexed, and is extremely ""inefficient"" - by putting this into a database, or using something like <a href=""http://ferret.davebalmain.com/"">Ferret</a>, it would be extremely much faster. But it works. Source:<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env rubyrequire &#039;rubygems&#039;require ""fcgi""a = File.read(""zhcn-en.txt"")FCGI.each_cgi do |cgi|  text = cgi[&#039;bigger&#039;]  search = text.gsub(/\.html/,&#039;&#039;)  puts ""Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8""  puts ""&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;#{search} |English-Chinese dictionary&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;""  puts &#039;&lt;meta http-equiv=""Content-Type""content=""text/html;charset=utf-8"" &gt;&#039;  puts ""&lt;body&gt;""  puts ""&lt;h1&gt;Search result for #{search}&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is asimple search of a database extracted from the interwikilinks of Chinese Wikipedia. shaklev@gmail.com&lt;/I&gt;&lt;p&gt;""puts ""&lt;table&gt;""  a.each do |line|    if line.downcase.match(search.downcase)      a,b=line.split(""\t"")      puts ""&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;"" + a + ""&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;"" + b + ""&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;""    end  end  puts ""&lt;/table&gt;""end</code></pre>I didn&#039;t bother writing a form page for it, but the API is extremely simple: http://reganmian.net/en-zh/<em>searchword</em>. Here are some examples:<p style=""text-align: left;""><a href=""http://reganmian.net/en-zh/Toronto"">http://reganmian.net/en-zh/Toronto</a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/en-zh/open access"">http://reganmian.net/en-zh/open access</a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/en-zh/sex"">http://reganmian.net/en-zh/sex</a>One advantage of the simple search is that it accepts both English and Chinese input, see for example:<a href=""http://reganmian.net/en-zh/开放获取"">http://reganmian.net/en-zh/开放获取</a><strong>Redirects and disambiguation</strong>When I initially entered ""open access"" in English Wikipedia, I arrived at a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dab_page"">disambiguation page</a> giving me <a href=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/open%20access"">links</a> to different meanings of the term, one of which, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_(publishing)"">Open access (publishing)</a>, was the one I wanted. It is also often the case that abbreviations, people&#039;s last names, etc. are redirected to the full article name. I figured it would be useful to have an index of all these disambiguations and redirects, so that I could incorporate that in the database. If, for example, NATO was a redirect to North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, I could have both of those two words function as headwords for the same Chinese term in the dictionary.And if you looked up open access, I could have (publishing): Chinese term, (infrastructure) different Chinese term, etc. The problem is that I would have to sort through the English database to do this, and the English dump is 7,8GB packed (probably something like 150GB unpacked - pure text). There is also a dump of redirects, however that is just an SQL dump, containing the ID of each article, and the title of the redirect, thus I would have to first import the SQL dump of page titles into a local SQL database. I tried, but it took for ever, and I gave up. This is not impossible, but it will take more time and more programming.<strong>Other dictionary formats</strong>Having a simple text file is great, you can grep it, and even build simple interfaces, like the web interface I mentioned above. But it would be great if we could also put this database into different dictionaries and lookup programs that already exist.First I thought about <a href=""http://www.wenlin.com/"">Wenlin</a>. Although it is proprietary, and has not been significantly updated for many years, it is still a very powerful program, which I use frequently when reading texts. I even made a <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2006/05/02/screencast-wenlin-helps-you-read-chinese/"">screencast</a> to showcase why I found it so useful. I wondered if it would be possible to import this dictionary into Wenlin. Turns out there is a way to import entries - you need to open a specially formatted textfile in Wenlin, and then choose ""import"". I was lucky enough to find a very interesting <a href=""http://dewenlin.com/"">German project</a> to create a German database for Wenlin, and they had a <a href=""http://dewenlin.com/liste.uni"">text file</a> that I could use as a model.The format looks like this:<pre><code>cidian.dbNew or changed entries:*** 1 ***pinyin                  zijūlicharacters               再拘留serial-number            1016904350reference                vwu3184a1part-of-speech           v.environment              lawdefinition               rearrest</code></pre>With some experimentation, I found that the <em>serial-number</em> and <em>reference</em> had to be there, but could be empty. <em>part-of-spech</em> and <em>environment</em> were not necessary at all. However, I needed two things. First of all, since simplified and traditional characters are not easy to automatically convert, the program requires that you specify both simplified and traditional characters. This was solved by using the scripts above to generate one file for simplified and one for traditional (the same content was on the same lines in each file, so it would be easy to combine them).In addition, Wenlin requires you to provide the pinyin for each word. This is because some characters have multiple readings, so that it is not easy to automatically generate (correct) pinyin for characters. I didn&#039;t need this, but Wenlin required it, and it even checked to see that each pinyin was a possible reading for the given Chinese character. So I needed somehow to get all the words rendered in pinyin.There are many services, and programs, that convert from Chinese text to pinyin. However, I couldn&#039;t find any good command line tools. Command line tools are very good when you are dealing with text files of many megabytes! I tried pasting the text into textfields in Firefox, and in stand-alone applications, and they all choked. Surprisingly, Wenlin itself was able to open the large (around 4MB) file, and it actually has a built-in conversion to pinyin. However, given that this cannot happen automatically, it tags each character with multiple readings, and asks you to select the correct one. I wasn&#039;t too preoccupied by having correct readings, just having possible readings that would be accepted by Wenlin would be enough, so I saved the result of the conversion (which took a while). Some lines looked like this:<pre>ln n sītuō 【◎Fix:◎wǎ;◎w;◎wā】 【◎Fix:◎zī;◎c】Linus Torvaldslǐ 【◎Fix:◎ch;◎zhā】 dsī tuō mn Richard Stallman</pre>And I had to use the search-and-replace with regexp function in <a href=""http://macromates.com/"">TextMate</a> to remove these options, leaving only the first one (as I mentioned, my goal was not to choose the correct reading, but a possible one).Combining all three files, I generated the file in Wenlin&#039;s required format, however because of all the space required per word, the file became quite large, and Wenlin was unable to cope with it (in fact, even trying to import 100 words automatically failed). I wish there was a command line tool that enabled me to import large amounts of words into Wenlin, but until then, I might have to give this venue up.<strong>Apple&#039;s Dictionary.app</strong>Initally, I thought that Dictionary.app, which is preinstalled on all Mac&#039;s, used dictd files, but it turns out they use some Apple-specific format. Luckily, this is <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/documentation/userexperience/Conceptual/DictionaryServicesProgGuide/Introduction/chapter_1_section_1.html"">well documented</a>, and there are tools for generating these files included on in the developer package. All you have to do is generate an XML file, which looks something like this<pre>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;&lt;d:dictionary xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""xmlns:d=""http://www.apple.com/DTDs/DictionaryService-1.0.rng""&gt;  &lt;d:entry id=""mathematics1""&gt;    &lt;d:index d:value=""mathematics"" d:title=""mathematics""/&gt;    &lt;h1&gt;mathematics&lt;/h1&gt;    &lt;p&gt;数学 (數學)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/d:entry&gt;  &lt;d:entry id=""philosophy2""&gt;    &lt;d:index d:value=""philosophy"" d:title=""philosophy""/&gt;    &lt;h1&gt;philosophy&lt;/h1&gt;    &lt;p&gt;哲学 (哲學)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/d:entry&gt;&lt;/d:dictionary&gt;</pre>Here is the script I wrote to generate this file:<pre><code>pinyin = File.open(&#039;english-pinyin.txt&#039;)cn = File.open(&#039;english-chinese.cn.txt&#039;)tw = File.open(&#039;english-chinese.tw.txt&#039;)result = File.open(&#039;MyDictionary.xml&#039;,&#039;w&#039;)result &lt;&lt; &#039;&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt; &lt;d:dictionary xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" xmlns:d=""http://www.apple.com/DTDs/DictionaryService-1.0.rng""&gt;&#039;counter = 0begin  pinyin.each do |line|    counter += 1    b, english = cn.readline.split(""\t"")    c, dummy = tw.readline.split(""\t"")    english.gsub!(/\((.*)\)/,&#039;&#039;)    english.downcase! english.strip! ; b.strip! ; c.strip!    result &lt;&lt; ""&lt;h1&gt;#{english}&lt;/h1&gt;    &lt;p&gt;#{b} (#{c})&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/d:entry&gt;""  endrescueendresult &lt;&lt; ""&lt;/d:dictionary&gt;""result.close</code></pre>After generating this file (you can download <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/MyDictionary.xml.zip"">an example</a> here), and editing the MyInfo.plist to reflect the name of the new dictionary, you can run make, and it will churn through, compile the dictionary and generate the index.

However, it is extremely speedy, and it would be nice if I could solve the problem above.I might also try to convert the dictionary into an actual dictd file, which should be easier. And I&#039;ve even thought of merging it somehow with CEDICT to get one large database (I found <a href=""http://www.math.umaine.edu/faculty/hiebeler/cedictscripts/"">some perl scripts</a> that might help with this).<strong>Conclusion</strong>This is how far I got in my amateur hacking this time, before it was time to turn back to studies and ""more important things"". It&#039;s interesting that I did a part of this work two years ago, when I wasn&#039;t blogging, and therefore didn&#039;t document it. These days, I figure I derive so much utility from other people&#039;s write ups about their problems and solutions, and neat hacks, that I ought to share my stuff with the world. Perhaps only a few people ever come across it, but to them it might be very useful. Also it&#039;s a great personal archive of things too - hadn&#039;t I found the script I wrote two years ago in GMail, it might have been lost.It also shows how useful semantically marked up data can be, especially when a website allows you to download it&#039;s entire database and do fun stuff with it, that they never even planned for. (Something similar was the case when I made the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2006/05/03/indonesian-dictionarymouseover-terbang-dengan-bahasa-indonesia/"">Indonesian mouse-over dictionary</a>). There&#039;s a large amount of useful tools out there, but they become much more useful if you can run them in command line mode. And there needs to be an easy to use, easy to create, and extract from, format for dictionaries, that all applications can read. (Maybe dictd is it, I need to learn more about it first).Stian","Open Access Week 2012: Looking back at five years of OA talks | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] the fact that Wikipedia is openly licensed, and downloadable, enables unintended usage, for example using interwiki links to create impressive dictionaries.

It only works off of titles (useful, no doubt), not quite sure I thought there would be anything else.So, someone mentioned this (maybe you as well), but we&#039;ve just been manually doing this. And for words that aren&#039;t in titles you pray for quality translations so you can match up sentence by sentence.Nonetheless, as they say in Xi&#039;an when the food is great (&#039;unrepresentable in english&#039;).. hsknotes => You are a hero to all peoples. With some hacks and updates this (already incredible) can be truly awesome.

Pontus Stenetorp => Really nicely done. I had the same idea back in early 2008. Since Swedish lacks dictionaries towards many languages I thought of a way to generate data for a free dictionary. This could indeed provide data for at least a complement for a Any Wikipedia language-Any other Wikipedia dictionary.I am happy to see that your work turned out so well. Looking forward to reading more from you. =)You have my up-vote on reddit, more people should see that playing with languages is fun..

When Your Dictionaries aren&#8217;t Good Enough&#8230;  Justrecently&#8217;s Weblog => [...] Random Matters discusses a rather technical approach (too technical for me). [...]. Stian Håklev => This would be the easiest thing in the world. Both the extraction code and the server code would work exactly the same for any other language. I even considered making the extraction code more generic, by having it accept command line parameters, but I decided to keep it simple. At the same time as the Chinese-English, I also generated Norwegian-Chinese and Esperanto-Chinese for a friend. I&#039;d love to see others playing with this code and sharing the results, but I would also be willing to make specific versions available if people request it (of course it also works for other Wikipedia language versions, ie German-Albanian etc, but of course for esoteric pairs, you might get fewer entries).. Stian Håklev => Thanks for this. As I stated in the blog, this is taken directly from the Wikipedia conversion tables circa 2007. I imagine that they have been somewhat improved by now (although probably not doubled, like the articles have), and I will try to extract a new version and post it to my blog later. In parenthesis, it would also be nice to have a conversion table that simply converted all the characters, without changing, for example, 电脑 into 计算机 etc for different jurisdictions. Personally I use TongWenTang plugin to convert webpages from traditional to simplified (http://tongwen.mozdev.org/). I guess I should just learn how to read traditional characters, since all the dailies in Toronto are in traditional, but.... Stian Håklev => That would be fun, but I wonder if it wouldn&#039;t have to be done partly manually. First of all, I might not want to ""pollute"" the database with lot&#039;s of dates, ""List of Harry Potter books"", etc. In addition, they also want pinyin, parts of speech etc.. Stian Håklev => Hi Leon. I have used that, and I find it very useful as well. Rather than amending the database, in the past I tried to completely replace the database (with a Hindi one), and my friend tried to replace it with an Esperanto one, but it failed miserably, not quite sure why. I find Mozilla plugins, with all their XML config and not, very convoluted, although I wish I knew how it worked. This is another thing that is needed - a generic mouseover dictionary plugin for Firefox, where you can easily plug in any dictionary (and maybe some simple grammar rules as well).. turbo24prg => Very nice idea. I&#039;m using this technique manually quite often. When automating this, you don&#039;t have to use any scraping yourself. Use semantic web technologies!The Wikipedia is already scraped and turned into RDF by the DBPedia Project. They have a SPARQL Endpoint you can use.:http://dbpedia.org/snorql/?query=SELECT+%3Fname+WHERE+{%0D%0A+++[+rdfs%3Alabel+%22Design+pattern%22%40en+%3B+rdfs%3Alabel+%3Fname+]+.%0D%0A+++FILTER+(LANG(%3Fname)+%3D+%27zh%27)+.%0D%0A}It may seem a bit confusing, but read about RDF and SPARQL and look at the DBPedia. It&#039;s really awesome.. Leon => Excellent stuff. I&#039;ve often wondered about amending Wenlin&#039;s dictionary, and always use wikipedia as a reference for Chinese/English proper noun conversion. Have you used the Chinese Pera-Kun plugin for Firefox? I find it very useful for reading firefox web pages, and it may be interesting to see how accessible its internal dictionary format is.

Shushan Wen => Good job! One thing is that when I tried the traditional/simplified Chinese conversion by using sed -f twcn or cnt, it works well in general, but there&#039;re still some characters are not mapped correctly once a while.For example, in twcn I can see s/迴/回/gbut in cntw it is s/回/回/gAnother example is cntw has a line ass/伙/夥/gbut twcn does not have the reverse mapping.Thanks for your attention,Shushan. est => haha, nice post, but generally we still write RMS and Linus directly in Chinese.

In both cases, the actual policies were in Norwegian, and in PDF files. I thought I&#039;d try to ferret out some of the details and share them with the readers of this blog, and of Open Access News.The first <a href=""http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/02/norwegian-research-council-adopts-oa.html"">announcement</a> was that the <a href=""http://www.forskningsradet.no/en/Home+page/1177315753906"">Norwegian Research Council</a> (who has clearly not heard about clean URLs) has adopted an Open Access mandate. The text of the mandate is in this <a href=""http://www.forskningsradet.no/servlet/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobheadername1=Content-Disposition%3A&amp;blobheadervalue1=+attachment%3B+filename%3DForskningsr%C3%A5detsOA-prinsipper.pdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1233638637436&amp;ssbinary=true"">PDF</a>. Here is an abridged translation of the text of the mandate:<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>NRC principles for access to scholarly publishing</strong></span><strong><em>1) Goal</em></strong>Results of publicly financed research should be publicly available.<em> Scholarly publishing partly or entirely funded by the Research Council shall to the largest extent possible be openly accessible for all those interested. To achieve this, the Research Council will contribute to enable the potential for dissemination and quality assurance of research results that is provided by open media and infrastructure to be exploited to the fullest.</em><em>[...] During the last few years, OA has gained in currency because certain international publishing houses have gained a monopoly position, which has led to a strong growth in the cost of journal subscriptions. This has put great pressure on institutional libraries. OA also covers other important research policy needs through a) strengthening the scholarly quality, through enabling more people to comment and build on published research results, b) through enabling business and other parties to easily access research results, c) through enabling government to find out about research results, d) through storing an unlimited amount of digital copies of articles, securing the access to today&#039;s published research results for the future, and e) to give researchers at institutions with lack of funding, especially in developing countries, access to the newest research results.</em><em>Two main pathways: green and gold.</em> (Interestingly, they state that in OA journals, publishing costs are covered in other ways than through subscription, usually through author pays. I don&#039;t think this conforms with the statistics we have.)<em>Green and gold refers to two different business models for publishing, self-archiving is no major threat to today&#039;s subscription based model, but can be expected to pressure the publishers to reduce prices because articles are publicly available after a while (usually six months). OA journals, on the other hand, challenge the established subscription model, and can lead to structural consequences that are had to predict today. For example the question about how author pay should be organized and financed in a sustainable fashion, is currently unclear.</em><em>OA is not limited to scientific journal articles. Anthology articles and monographs are other examples of peer-reviewed publications that can be seen in an OA perspective. However, journal articles constitute the dominant form of publishing - internationally, and across disciplines. It is therefore useful to limit the NRC&#039;s OA principles to this publishing form. </em>(They don&#039;t mention history for example, where monographs are the main vehicle, and the also don&#039;t mention that an important reason why OA monographs might be harder, is that authors receive some royalty. However, there is of course a growing movement of OA monographs and university presses as well).A discussion about encouraging deposits, and mandating it - international experience shows that encouragement doesn&#039;t work, but mandates do.<strong>2</strong><em><strong>) The NRC&#039;s demands for OA to scholarly publishing</strong>The social benefits connected with OA to scholarly publishing are substantial. Therefore, the NRC will demand that peer-reviewed scientific articles, based on research that is entirely or partly financed by the NRC will be self-archived in appropriate archives, where these exist. These demands for archival must not conflict with the academic and legal rights of the authors.</em><em>The researchers&#039; right to independently choose the ""publishing channel"" for their own scientific results is an important aspect of academic freedom. But researchers also carry an academic commitment to publish in a way that allows the peer community and the greater community to get sufficient access to these results. The principle of the individual researchers independently choosing the channel of publications for their research results can be challenged in two ways through the demand for OA.</em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>1) The demand for self-archiving can limit the possibility of publishing in journals that today don&#039;t accept this.</em></span><em> </em><em>Most Norwegian and international journals, however, currently accept self-archiving. The demand for self-archiving from ever more research institutions and funders makes it only a question of time before this becomes common practice. In the cases where self-archiving is still not allowed, the NRC should be able to accept an exception from the demand to self-archive.</em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>2) OA-publishing that is financed through author pays can lead to new financial and administrative limitations.</em></span><em> </em><em>It would be unfortunate if the research environments gain decision power over who get the funding to publish, and thus are actually ble to fund. The NRC should therefore be careful about establishing incentives that contribute to changing fundamental publishing patterns, before there is enough knowledge about the results of author-financed publishing.</em><em>When the NRC mandates that researchers self-archive Copyright-protected materials in institutional archives, the NRC must ensure that such archiving does not contradict the legal rights to this material by the author and the publisher. This is for example relevant in connection with secondary use of published material, such as readers for use in education. UHR and the collective rights organizations are currently negotiating about the use of digital material at institutions. A future agreement will probably be able to clarify the Copyright aspects of secondary use of material from digital archives, and the NRC will respect such an agreement and the demand it puts on self-archiving.</em>(This is strange? Does not open access include that you can create readers for free?)<em></em><em><strong>3) Self-archiving: Infrastructure and user perspective</strong>Scientific articles that fit the demands in part two should be archived in an electronic archive (repository), either at the researcher&#039;s institution, or in a disciplinary repository. Normally a post-print version of the article should be archived. If the author publishes in a journal that does not allow such publishing, and has not received permission to archive after having asked for this, the individual can be exempted from the demand to self-archive.</em><em>The technical and administrative infrastructure for self-archiving is to a large degree already present at Norwegian education and research institutions, for example through DUO at UiO and BIBSYS&#039; Brage-Solution. The health sector has developed a common system (HERA), while there is varying coverage within the independent research institutes. There are also international subject-specific open archives within each research area, for example the UK PubMed Central. If this is an archive that increases the visibility of publications, or is mandated as an archival location by other organizations, the NRC should encourage users to use these.</em><em>Userfriendliness is an important facotr to ensure that researchers self-archive without perceiving it as an extra burden. A task force established by the Knowledge Department</em> (""Ministry of Education"" in Norway) <em>has recently submitted a proposal for a common database of scholarly publishing within a national system for research information. [...] The background for the research is the need to gather the research from the health sector, tertiary institutions and independent research institutes in one register, which will significantly simplify the work of self-archiving. This will depend on how the report is received in the department.</em><em>Such a project should also inform the researchers about their legal rights related to Copyright, and what version of the article that they can upload. The NRC and other institutions that mandate self-archiving, must still be expected to provide guidance about authors&#039; rights related to self-archiving.</em><em><strong>4) Collaboration and advice</strong>OA is in continuous development, and can in the long-term lead to large-scale changes in publishing patterns and practices within research and academia. It is important that the principles of the NRC reflect these developments, and can be adapted if the circumstances so demand. To ensure that the principles at all times ensure the goal of OA to scholarly publishing, the NRC will establish a good dialogue about the principles with relevant institutions and collaborators.</em><em>The NRC shall provide th government with give research policy advice. The KD has [...] asked the NRC and UHR to provide advice about measures that can promote self-archiving and other OA publishing. The Department is especially interested in a consideration of whether self-archiving should be mandated for publicly funded research, and what legal, technological, communications, economics, administrative and other consequences that might arise from this. The NRC&#039;s feedback to the Department have been designed according to the principles of OA to scholarly publishing.</em><hr />The second <a href=""http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/02/norwegian-universities-recommend-green.html"">announcement</a> is a report from a working group of the <span class=""rss:item""><a href=""http://www.uhr.no/om_uhr/about_uhr"">Norwegian Association of Higher Education Institutions</a> (<em>Universitets- og hgskolerdet</em> or UHR) who were asked by the </span><span class=""rss:item""> <a href=""http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd.html?id=586"">Ministry of Education and Research</a> (<em>Kunnskapsdepartemente</em> or KD) to come up with recommendations regarding OA. The <a href=""http://www.uhr.no/documents/Rapport_fra_Open_Access_arbeidsgruppe.pdf"">report</a> is 37 pages, and I have made an abridged translation of the executive summary, as well as mentioned a few interesting tidbits from the text itself.</span><strong>Increased access to Norwegian research results</strong><em>Recommendations from a working group established by the research committee of UHR</em>(A number of reasons why OA would be good). <em>The UHR working group belives that access to scientific results is an important research policy question. A positive attitutde to the OA initiative at the KD will have a great importance for the development within the institutions. KD should therefore support free access in the policy development and follow-up of universities and colleges. The KD should encourage institutions to develop strategies and guidelines that contribute to OA for scientific publications in their strategies for research.</em><em>The long-term goal should be that all scientific articles that result from publicly financed research should be publicly available, unless there is a strong reason for limiting access. The short-term goal should be that 50% of all published scientific articles are openly accessible within 2015. </em>(This doesn&#039;t seem very ambitious...) <em>To reach this goal, the researchers themselves must see the advantages of free access, and be willing to employ the opportunities granted by new technology.</em><em>KD should prioritize supporting the further development and use of institutional archives. This does not preclude publishing in OA-journals. To succeed, the institutions must have a conscious idea about quality, and what they want to achieve with their institutional archives.</em><em>The work group separates between the submission itself, and the public dissemination of the published articles. The group believes that the institutions can demand submission of scientific publications because of the need for oversight, testability, and institutional memory. The submission of a published article will not automatically lead to it being made accessible, that requires permission from the researchers. The group believes it to be probable that most people who are asked to do so, will give their permission, given that they have been well-informed, the question of rights has ben taken care of, and the infrastructure is in place.</em><em>Good infrastructure is about archives that are easy to use. It is a big advantage if the full-text archive is directly connected to the research documentation system. The institutions should facilitate administrative follow-up in regards to submissions, clearing rights and making submissions accessible, as well as having a communications plan that clarify the advantages of OA. They should also encourage the researchers to keep the rigto make their works accesible in their own archives, disciplinary archive or institutional archive at publishing. This will demand resources, and in the short-term the benefit will not lead to decreased costs.</em><em>In addition to the work of influencing institutions, KD should prioritize the following measures at a national level:</em><ul><li><em> establish the Norvegian science index (NVI) with links to institutional archives</em></li><li><em> take intiative to negotiations with the publishing houses about national subscription and license conditions</em></li><li><em> continue NORA (Norwegian Open Research Archive), at least for the current year. This function should also be considered in light of NVI</em></li></ul><em>The Department should also consider other measures to cover costs related to publishing in Open Access journals.</em><em>To avoid these measures having unexpected consequences, the Norwegian publishing industry should be closely followed.</em><strong>From the main text</strong><ul><li>About 2% of all Norwegian publications are currently available in Norwegian repositories, and 47% were published in journals that allow this. This might be a low estimate, a technical university found that 91% of all publications were in journals that allow self-archiving.</li><li>A Norwegian consortium of universities spends about $10 million USD per year on international journal subscriptions.</li><li>Much of the humanities is published in Norwegian or Nordic languages and in these countries, there are no publishers that have monopolies, and the costs are usually quite reasonable. They discuss ways to make the Norwegian journals open-access, either by moving to author-pays, or by having NRC support all running costs.</li><li>They say: <em>Many of the small, Norwegian scientific journals are to a large extent based on public financing. This is partly through direct support, but also through subscriptions that are charged to public budgets (universities etc, my addition), and must be seen as part of the public support for the journals. In addition is revenue from private subscriptions. At a transition to OA, whether it happens through author pays or through direct support, the journals will lose the revenue from the non-public subscribers. If this loss of revenue is lower than the reduced costs of a transition to OA, then it will be beneficial for the public to facilitate a transition to OA. Such a transition would help strenghten the public discourse, Norwegian as an academic language, and to a certain extent Norwegian language and culture at foreign universities.</em></li><li>They conclude that today&#039;s Norwegian publishing industry seems robust and healthy, and we have to be careful to rock the boat - we need more analysis of how a new system would affect the whole situation before proceeding.</li></ul>Stian","The English-Chinese dictionary, revisited","china,languages,personal,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/02/23/the-english-chinese-dictionary-revisited/,"My previous post on extracting an English-Chinese dictionary garnered a fair amount of attention, I got <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7xwst/englishchinese_dictionary_based_on_wikipedia/"">reddit</a>&#039;ed (on their frontpage for a short time), <a href=""http://internet.solidot.org/index.pl?issue=20090217"">solidot</a>&#039;ed, mentioned on the <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/chinajournal/2009/02/18/best-of-the-china-blogs-february-18/"">Wall Street Journal blog</a>, and more. Very fun. About 10,000 page views in three days, and a bunch of comments, both here and at Reddit. It was fun to follow the referrers in the log and see how the article spread, first through some big portals, then being picked up by others, as well as personal blogs, twitter, etc.For the simple dictionary server I wrote - which was only a small part of my article, but I guess the most immediate and visible way of testing it out - I generate a simple log file. I don&#039;t want to infringe anyone&#039;s privacy, so I am not logging IP or anything, simply the word that is searched for. I just had a look at this file, and here are the stats. First, I did a quick<pre>cat log | wc</pre>to see how many words (ie. searches) had been performed. The result is 2,819. Then I did a<pre>cat log | sort | uniq | wc</pre>this shows me how many different unique words have been searched for (ie if five people searched for China, that would be one entry - doesn&#039;t account for misspellings of course). The result was 702 different words. Then I wanted to make an overview over the most frequent search words, but I couldn&#039;t immediately think of a way to do this using shell commands. So I wrote a quick Ruby script. (Note, I could of course have imported this into a spreadsheet, but what if it had been a million rows?)<pre><code>text = File.read(ARGV[0])counter = {}text.each do |line|  counter[line] = counter[line] ? counter[line] + 1 : 1endputs ""&lt;table&gt;""counter.sort {|a,b| b[1]&lt;=&gt;a[1]}.each do |key|  puts ""&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;"" + key[0].chomp + ""&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;"" +key[1].to_s + ""&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;""endputs ""&lt;/table&gt;""</code></pre>This gave the following top searches:<table border=""0""><tbody><tr><td>searchword</td><td>414</td></tr><tr><td>sex</td><td>376</td></tr><tr><td>Toronto</td><td>253</td></tr><tr><td>open access</td><td>174</td></tr><tr><td>test.cgi/</td><td>148</td></tr><tr><td>天安门</td><td>146</td></tr><tr><td>北京</td><td>135</td></tr><tr><td>开放获取</td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td>telephone</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>托福</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>很好很强大</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>上海</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>favicon.gif</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Dictionary</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>favicon.ico</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>toronto</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>word</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>中国</td><td>7</td></tr></tbody></table>It&#039;s an interesting combination. First, I notice that things that I link to in my article appears very frequently. I began talking about my server in my previous article with the text: I didn&rsquo;t bother writing a form page for it, but the API is extremely simple: http://reganmian.net/en-zh/<em>searchword. </em>Since the searchword is italicized, my intent was for the user to replace that with whatever they wanted to search for, and unlike my subsequent real examples, this URL wasn&#039;t even linked, but still people ended up clicking on it (finding no hits, and hopefully not abandoning the dictionary just because of this).The second hit is sex, unsurprisingly. And apart from being titillating, this is a searchword that really illustrates the strength of this dictionary compared to other more traditional ones. The result is 141 headwords, as diverse as <a href=""http://reganmian.net/en-zh/East Sussex"">East Sussex</a>, <a href=""http://reganmian.net/en-zh/Oral sex in Islamic law"">Oral sex in Islamic law</a>, <a href=""http://reganmian.net/en-zh/Sex Pistols"">Sex Pistols</a> and <a href=""http://reganmian.net/en-zh/Psyochopathia Sexualis"">Psyochopathia Sexualis</a>. I certainly didn&#039;t know how to translate metrosexual or genetic sexual attraction to Chinese, but now I do. (And, incidentally, this blog will probably be blocked in all British Schools, and Saudi Arabia).<a href=""http://reganmian.net/en-zh/Toronto"">Toronto</a> and <a href=""http://reganmian.net/en-zh/Open Access"">Open Access</a> where both examples I provided, but test.cgi/ is an interesting one. It has a huge amount of hits, and as far as I know, hasn&#039;t been listed anywhere. I am curious if this is an automated attempt at exploiting a vulnerability. Then we get some Chinese ones, like <a href=""http://reganmian.net/en-zh/天安门"">天安门</a> (Tiananmen), <a href=""http://reganmian.net/en-zh/北京"">北京</a> (Beijing) and <a href=""http://reganmian.net/en-zh/开放获取"">开放获取</a> (Open Access).Further down, we find ""很好很强大"". It literally means ""very good, very strong"", but is a Chinese internet meme which can be used to express strong surprise (and often unhappiness) with something. According to <a href=""http://ultrarvid.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!28A06226450F9F83!572.entry"">this blogger</a> (in Chinese), the expression can be traced back to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Ping_Mei"">Jin Ping Mei</a>, a Chinese erotic classic. Although there is a nice <a href=""http://zh.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E5%BE%88%E5%A5%BD%E5%BE%88%E5%BC%BA%E5%A4%A7&amp;variant=zh-cn"">Wikipedia entry in Chinese</a>, there is no English corresponding article, and thus no entry in the dictionary.By the way, I made a corresponding dictinary for traditional characters at http://reganmian.net/en-tw/search-something. Now we&#039;ll see if in a while, when I check it&#039;s log, ""search-something"" is the top search word...Stian","Sepra => Great post. Excellent article.

This is both an opportunity to practice for students who are planning to present at for example <a href=""http://www.tc.edu/cies2009/"">CIES</a> or <a href=""http://www.aera.net/Default.aspx?id=5348"">AERA</a>, but also a great opportunity to break down some walls and learn about what other departments and divisions are doing. Before I even enrolled at OISE, I went to one of these conferences, and it gave me a great overview of the kind of research conducted at OISE, gave me contacts among some students doing interesting research, and was overall a great experience.This year, I wanted to see if we could put together a panel on open education, since I keep feeling that OISE as one of the world&#039;s premier institutions conducting research on education ought to be more aware of this growing trend. We ended up with a great panel, featuring three presentations on open education, and one about institutional university networks and cooperation. I put the two presentations I were involved in on Slideshare, and linked to them below. Note that the audio is quite poor, since I was recording with Audacity and my laptop&#039;s built-in mic.In general, I found the presentation format challenging, because the audience had no experience with open education. Thus, I was torn between providing a general introduction to open education, and presenting my cutting-edge research or ideas - all in 15 minutes (luckily we had three presentations that could build on each other). It&#039;s good practice though, to try to boil messages down and still make them comprehensible and compelling.<a href=""http://cide.oise.utoronto.ca/people/profile_expanded.php?sID=4135"">Kirk Perris</a>, who is writing his PhD on the open universities in India and China, invited me to present with him on open education in China and India:<div id=""__ss_1151222"" style=""width: 425px; text-align: left;""><a style=""font:14px Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;display:block;margin:12px 0 3px 0;text-decoration:underline;"" title=""Open Educational Resources in India and China: Reshaping Periphery and Core?"" href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/open-educational-resources-in-india-and-china-reshaping-periphery-and-core?type=powerpoint"">Open Educational Resources in India and China: Reshaping Periphery and Core?</a><object width=""425"" height=""355"" data=""http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=dgsrcperrishaklevmarch6-090316085434-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=open-educational-resources-in-india-and-china-reshaping-periphery-and-core"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true"" /><param name=""allowScriptAccess"" value=""always"" /><param name=""src"" value=""http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=dgsrcperrishaklevmarch6-090316085434-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=open-educational-resources-in-india-and-china-reshaping-periphery-and-core"" /><param name=""allowfullscreen"" value=""true"" /></object></div>And I gave a presentation outlining some of my thoughts on evaluation and accreditation of open education.

I have in the past called for the use of more theory when researching OER, and part of the reason why that doesn&#8217;t happen, is that many who are attending open education conferences in North America are not from schools of education, or have backgrounds in relevant fields. They are doing incredibly important work, and creating great innovations, but I keep wishing that more people within the field of education would begin studying this area (which is also why I this year presented on OER at CIES, and at the OISE Dean&#8217;s Conference).

"Open Education Videos around the world: The Making Of,"china,events,India,languages,movies,open-education,personal,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/16/open-education-videos-around-the-world-the-making-of/,"<strong>Background</strong>During the presentation on <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/12/links-from-the-talk-open-education-around-the-world/"">Open Education around the world</a> at OISE last week, I wanted to really highlight to people the incredible array of resources available, in many different languages. I also discussed three different purposes of openness, direct use (by target audience, usually students), reuse (ie. recontextualized by a teacher or other intermediary before it reaches the target audience) and transparency (open the windows and let people look in - heavily influenced by <a href=""http://mikecaulfield.com/2009/01/25/openness-as-reuse-and-openness-as-transparency/"">Mike Caulfield</a>). Thus, I blazed through something like <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/open-education-around-the-world"">105 slides</a>, much of it screenshots from OERs in different languages and contexts.I&#039;ve in the past wanted to show snippets of video lectures when giving presentations, but never been able to. Although I realize that video lectures are far from the pedagogical (or andragogical) apex, there is something very fascinating about being able to watch a lecture at MIT, or at a Chinese university, that cannot be replaced by a boring looking text, especially from the transparency perspective. However, where I was presenting, I could not trust that the internet would be fast enough, often there were introductory segments that I needed to skip, I just wanted to show little snippets, and I thought it would just become too much of a disruption of the presentation.For this presentation, I had more time than usual (2 hours is incredibly generous, yet we were still pressed for time, and would have liked more for the Q&amp;A), and more than ever I wanted to impress on the audience the incredibly idea that we could look through the virtual windows of classrooms all around the world. Instead of trying to preload a bunch of clips, and play snippets of them, I decided to try to edit together a quick video showcasing a few seconds from lectures in as many languages as possible. Of course, I decided this around 11PM on the night before the presentation, which didn&#039;t leave me much sleep in the end, for a 10AM presentation.<strong>The process</strong>It turned out to be a lot more difficult than I had thought. I decided to use iMovie, since it was preinstalled on my Mac, and I didn&#039;t need any kind of advanced editing, just splicing together and perhaps adding some text. First, I had to find the source material of course. MIT was easy, they offer the videos for download, and they provide a license that allows this to happen. In addition, for English-language content, there are sites that collect video lectures, such as <a href=""http://videolectures.net/"">videolectures.net</a>, or even iTunes, so it wouldn&#039;t have been hard to find good content outside of MIT. As it was, I wasn&#039;t trying to showcase the rich world of English-language lectures, so I settled for some clips of MIT&#039;s most downloaded course on physics (<a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Physics/8-01Physics-IFall1999/CourseHome/index.htm"">8.01</a>).I knew that both <a href=""http://www.ignou.ac.in/"">Indira Gandhi National Open University</a> (IGNOU, which I have <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/12/04/worlds-largest-university-opens-almost-all-its-materials/"">written about before</a>) and the IITs (<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/06/opencourseware-around-the-world-china-and-india/"">likewise</a>) had published great videos on Youtube. In addition, IGNOU also provided some lectures in Hindi, so that I could provide both Hindi and English lectures. Given that these were on Youtube, I was able to grab the Flash videos and convert them to a format that iMovie would read using <a href=""http://handbrake.fr/"">Handbrake</a>.Next, for the Chinese courses. This is what I&#039;ve done the most research on (see <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/02/12/presentation-on-opencourseware-in-china-posted-to-slideshare/"">my previous presentation</a>) and I knew that most of their courses had video components, however these were often streamed and in RealMedia. For some reason, the <a href=""http://www.archive.org"">Internet Archive</a> has a <a href=""http://www.archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&amp;mediatype=education&amp;collection=chinese_u_lectures"">large collection of older courses</a>, and here I was able to find one that was in WMV format, and once again convert it to a format legible by iMovie. I found one in Chinese, and a rare one in English (most Chinese university courses are taught in Chinese, but they are beginning to experiment with some English courses to increase the English level of their graduates).This was the easy part, but I wanted more. Through <a href=""http://www.haishuolee.com/"">Lee Haishuo</a>, I found out about <a href=""http://www.castalia.jp/top"">Castalia</a>, which features Japanese lectures. I also found some video lectures through Instituto Tecnologico de Monterey, however these were only available in streaming format. I spent a long time searching for how to download the stream, how to convert from RealMedia to iMovie, etc, and finally I came across a simpler solution. I used <a href=""www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/"">SnapZ Pro</a> to do a ""screencast"" of the area of the screen where the movie was streaming, and then imported the resulting QuickTime file into iMovie. Worked perfectly, but the videos were already quite low quality - not sure how well it would work with higher resolution video.So, I managed to get it all into iMovie, and then it was easy. Choose a few sections, put on some titles, export it to QuickTime, embed it into the PowerPoint slides, and of course, put it on YouTube. The result was 2,5 minutes long, visits five countries and five languages, and can be seen here:<object width=""480"" height=""295"" data=""http://www.youtube.com/v/eRbWXKnxB2c&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true"" /><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always"" /><param name=""src"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/eRbWXKnxB2c&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"" /><param name=""allowfullscreen"" value=""true"" /></object><strong>Lessons learnt</strong>It&#039;s kind of ironic, in a talk about Open Education and the ideas of remix, etc, how difficult it was to do this. The first part is finding the material. I wanted a snippet from a Korean lecture, and I know there are Korean video lectures out there. I would go to the <a href=""http://www.ocwconsortium.org/"">OpenCourseWare Consortium</a> site, and get a list of Korean universities (as an aside, I wish all these links went to the OCW page of the institution, not the mainpage - sometimes I would arrive at the mainpage of an institution, search for OCW, and not find anything there). I would visit each university&#039;s OCW collection, choose a faculty, choose a course, and say ""oh, this course doesn&#039;t have any video lectures""... Start again. Not very efficient. Why can&#039;t I search for Korean courses that have video lectures about economics, or courses in English, German or Italian (I speak all three) that have exam questions? (I know this is being worked on, and is partly dependent on how much metadata is generated by the sites, etc).When I had found a file, it was often very hard to reuse it. Streaming video is not easy to reuse, or even just to save offline for distribution to people who don&#039;t have internet access etc. An additional problem is that several of these resources didn&#039;t actually use open licenses - especially for the Indian and Chinese projects. It&#039;s there, but you don&#039;t have an explicit license to use it. Some Chinese educators I have spoken with make the point that they haven&#039;t used an open license, because they don&#039;t see copyright as a problem, not because they don&#039;t want people to copy it. But if I am at University of Toronto, and want to translate one of these videos and use it in my classes, the institution might not let me.Ideally, what I&#039;d like to see happen more is for institutions to not insist so much on hosting everything on their own site, but to share it using existing Web 2.0 platforms. Although the license is still a problem, it was easy for me to find videos for the Indian projects, because they are on YouTube. Just like the Library of Congress <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/"">posting photos on flickr </a>enables people to tag, link to, embed, etc - having video on Youtube (or somewhere else - it doesn&#039;t even have to be a commercial service, it could be archive.org), would make reuse and findability a lot easier. Put your pictures on flickr, your slides on SlideShare, your curricula on WikiEducator, etc. But of course, part of the way OCW in particular is financed, or ""sold"" to the institutions, is that it will be a strong tool for branding and marketing, so institutions might be loth to give up on the specialized sites that you have to visit. (I know this is beginning to happen, with iTunes for example, but I&#039;d like to see much more).I&#039;d love to expand this video with more language examples, because I think it would be a great fun thing to be able to include in future talks about OCW, etc.Stian"," OLDaily per Stephen Downes, 19 de març de 2009 TIC, E/A, FER / PER&#8230;: => [...] vegades en YouTube.&#8221; Relacionat: (com s&#8217;han fet els vdeos d&#8217;educaci oberta / Open Education Videos around the world: The Making Of).

This year, it starts even earlier, because we don&#039;t have any exams at OISE. Next week, I am going to CIES in Charleston, then I am back for a week of classes, and then I am off to Beijing (via Hong Kong).China will be my base this summer. Primarily, I will conduct field research for my project on OpenCourseWare in China, visiting universities and libraries etc. But I&#039;ve also always wanted to spend some significant time in Beijing, and this time I should have two+ months to get to know the city, make some contacts, attend events etc. I would especially love to meet anyone involved with open source, Creative Commons, open culture, etc. Right now, I am trying to find a place to sublet there. I will also be doing brief travels to a few other cities to do research and see some old friends.In June, I am going to Milan for <a href=""http://conferences.aepic.it/elpub2009/"">ElPub 2009</a> (ironically, I missed it last year, when it was held at University of Toronto, because I was in India). I am also hoping to be able to attend the <a href=""http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=48321"">CERN workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication (OAI6)</a> in Geneva, taking the train up there. This depends on whether my poster is accepted - if it is, I will get some of the registration fee subsidized by my school. If not, I will meet some old friends in Italy, and see how much of the language I&#039;ve forgotten. I got an extremely good fare by the Emirates, which included a three day stop-over in Dubai, which I&#039;ven ever visited before.Back to China, and just in time to receive my family, who is arriving to partake in our wedding. Yes, we did get married in October in Toronto, but we&#039;re doing it again, this time with families from both sides,a nd hopefully many friends. It will be the first week of July in Zhanjiang, southern China, and we are sending out invitations this weekend.After that, I am returning to Toronto on the 5th of August, and hoping to participate in the <a href=""http://olt.ubc.ca/spotlight/at_a_glance/ubc_events/?CA=49458"">Open Education 2009</a> conference at UBC (Vancouver will be another first time for me). I will probably spend much of August both ""wallowing in my data"", as one of my professors said, and also working on a Student Experience Project with KMDI about Open Educational Resources. Then, in September, it&#039;s back to school - which is fun, because my advisor Ruth Hayhoe will be back, and offering two very interesting courses.If anyone who reads this are along my ""route"" this summer, or anywhere in China, please let me know, since I&#039;d love to meet up.Stian","Carlotta James => Stian nihao!,Awesome summer plans...life is meant for living.I have a good friend in Dubai--I could give you his details or vice versa--maybe you could stay with him.. "407 Indonesian textbooks openly available,"asia,books,development,economics,libraries,open access,open-education,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/19/407-indonesian-textbooks-openly-available/,"<strong>Background</strong>Back in May 2007, when I attended the World Book Day in Jakarta, I heard about plans to purchase the copyrights for school textbooks, and make the books freely available, to alleviate the problem of students who could not afford to purchase them. I thought it was a very interesting idea, but hoped that they would also use a Creative Commons or similar open license, and make these available online for anyone around the world to both benefit from them (for example in Malaysia, where their language is very similar to Indonesian), but also crucially to improve upon them.I later wrote about <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/02/08/indonesian-government-wants-to-buy-text-book-copyrights/"">the official announcement of this plan</a>, about <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/07/indonesian-text-books-first-copyrights-bought/"">the first copyrights being bought</a>, and on <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/07/more-thoughts-on-indonesian-project-to-buy-copyrights/"">more thoughts about the project</a>. Recently, when I was putting together the slides for my presentation on <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/16/open-education-around-the-world-presentation-at-oise/"">Open Education around the world</a>, I thought I&#039;d visit this project again and include a slide. That&#039;s when I found out that the first batch of books had <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/16/open-education-around-the-world-presentation-at-oise/"">already been made available</a> - 407 of them.<img class=""size-medium wp-image-318 alignleft"" title=""School children in Indonesia"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-20-300x204.png"" alt=""School children in Indonesia"" width=""300"" height=""204"" /><strong>Available!</strong>At the website ""Buku Sekolah Elektronik"" (electronic school books) under the Indonesian Ministry of Education, they have all 407 books available for download. The books range from primary school to high school, and seem to cover all subjects. There is a system for reading books online, and you can also download individual PDFs of each chapter. However, you have to log in to the system, and you have to agree to the following conditions before downloading/viewing (my translation):The user can download or print files from Buku Sekolah Elektronik, as well as copy and sell, as long as:<em>1. The copier and/or seller is of Indonesian nationality or is legally settled in Indonesia (it could also mean, is a legal enterprise in Indonesia, I&#039;m not quite sure)2. You have to mention your identity on the first page of the books that are sold/distributed.3. The specifications of the text book for sale has to be according to the directions given by the National Minister of Education.4. The sales price for books that are allowed to be copied for sale must not be higher than the maximum sales price which has been determined by the National Minister of Education.5. The text book which is copied for sale has to note the sales price on the back cover of the book.6. The user has to follow the regulations above and any other relevant regulations.</em>It seems that these conditions only apply to copying and selling the books, not personal use, so I am still allowed to download these, even though I am not an Indonesian citizen. You can also <a href=""http://www.diknas.info/pemesanan"">order a CD</a> with all the books for 100,000 Rp (8.4$ USD), including postage within Indonesia. The price falls by 50% if you order more than 100 copies. Interestingly, at <a href=""http://www.diknas.info/"">another site</a>, run by private individuals, you can download all the books without having to register, or agree to the conditions above, one pdf per book rather than per chapter.<strong>Analysis</strong>It is wonderful that these books are now available. I find it very interesting how textbooks in different countries deliver information, both in terms of content and design/pedagogics, and now I can see how Indonesian textbooks teach about history, math, economics, etc. For comparative educators, this should be a wonderful resource.I obviously think it would have been better to use a Creative Commons license. I suspect that the main reason they have not done so, is because they want to control printing, to make sure that everyone keeps within a maximum price. However, with a CC Non-Commercial license, they could still have attached conditions to commercial printing (maybe even through CC+), but would have allowed for free non-commercial reuse. The limitation that only Indonesian citizens can reuse it seems unecessary - I don&#039;t think there is any great export of Indonesian textbooks to anywhere else in the world.But the issue of openness doesn&#039;t stop with the license. It would be wonderful if we could get not only PDFs of these books, but the source files - whether they are InDesign or PageMaker, or even Word .doc files, so that we could translate these to another language, and keep the illustrations. It would be even better if all the text was available in a Wiki, where people could work together on collaboratively improving them (with quality assurance functions, reviews etc). Then, the Indonesian government could really leverage the opening of these books.<strong>Research questions</strong>I sometimes say that I wish I had a lab full of grad students... as a 1st year MA, that&#039;s a weird statement to make, but I come up with so many possible interesting research questions, but I can&#039;t research them all myself. For example, it would be a great example for an economist to look at - how does this scheme work in terms of the stated goal, which is to make textbooks available more cheaply? Would it be better to not have a maximum price, and let competition drive down prices (probably work in Jakarta, but maybe not in a remote island, of which there are many in Indonesia)? How does having access to all these books on a CD change the way teachers select books? Do they ever borrow material from other books to integrate into their teaching?Even though this project is far from ""perfect"" from an open purist&#039;s view, it&#039;s still a wonderful initiative, and it will be very exciting to follow how it develops.Stian","Random Stuff that Matters  Blog Archive  Encouraging sharing without getting all lawyery => [...] hand, there is a lot of great material being released &#8220;openly&#8221; in for example India, Indonesia and China, but none of this material uses an open license, and I would really love if it could. On [...]. Espen Stranger-Johannessen => This makes me think of the possibilities of making open sources textbooks (or proto-textbooks) for other countries as well. Say people (such as teachers) used a wiki to make a textbook in thrird year math for Kenya. This could serve as a proto-textbook for math in other countries, and one could make the appropriate adaptions, even translations. By focusing on chapters rather than whole textbooks that are supposed to cover the curriculum for one year, it will probably easier for teachers to adapt it to their purpose, and small booklets can easily be made on a chapter or topic basis (i.e., multiplication). Having pictures from other such books could also be very helpful. I don&#039; need to understand a word of Bahasa Indonesian so make use of one of the nice pictures in the these books!So, Stian, how about spending a rainy day on making such a wiki? I promise I will contribute by writing something!Espen. L.T. Handoko => Thanks a lot for your great attention to our country. Your ideas and suggestions are very wonderful.I would like to make some comments :1) You are correct that the terms and conditions are intended for commercial purpose of the books, not for the personal users.2) So the website is not the single source for the books. You can find many mirrors at some universities across Indonesia in which you don&#039;t need to register yourself etc. Or, you can find it at our BUKU-e LIPI (http://www.buku-e.lipi.go.id) which is also mirroring all of the books but with different perspective. Because BUKU-e LIPI is intended for more general open books related to both science and scientific education.3) Even the books are open and fully free, all of the contents should and have passed certain standard of quality by BSNP (http://www.bsnp-indonesia.org) who is an independent body. Note : the Minister of National Education in Indonesia now is no longer super body, they must not make any regulation on substances o education system, and just follow the standard determined by BSNP and are responsible for the technical implementations. 4) Your suggestion to make the books to be fully open, including the sources are very nice. However, even now everyone is basically still free to use the whole / part of the books just like the Creative Commons license. Even the teachers are allowed to make their own textbooks based on the part of official textbooks, etc.Your idea to make a ""wiki-like"" system is very great. This is of course allowed, but it has not been implemented yet due to technical limitations, especially of the writers who are not always familiar with the internet technology. Technically, the approach has been implemented fully at BUKU-e LIPI.5) One of the idea behind the open textbook is to eliminate the cheating price created by the publishers and the teachers that was very common phenomena in the past. So, setting the maximum price would prevent it. For the private schools they are free to choose the textbooks. But, for state owned schools, they are allowed to purchase the textbooks which have obtained BSNP&#039;s certificates, it does not matter the books are from the freely available open textbooks or not.6) At BUKU-e LIPI, as mentioned above, you can find similar open-books with opportunities for the readers to give feedbacks, having discussions with the authors interactively in forum-like approach, not the wiki-like. The sources are also available if the author wish to open it.The open textbooks with such scale might be the first attempt around the world. We are welcome your encouraging comments... Thx !. "Public domain books in many languages,"books,china,languages,libraries,open access,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/20/public-domain-books-in-many-languages/,"<img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 2px 8px;"" src=""http://www.gutenberg.org/pics/pg-logo-002.png"" alt="""" width=""129"" height=""80"" />I&#039;ve long been fascinated by book scanning projects, and written before about OpenLibrary and Universal Library, as well as Google Books. However, as neat as these projects are, we shouldn&#039;t forget sites like <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/"">Project Gutenberg</a>, which have been around for much longer. Project Gutenberg relies on volunteers to scan, OCR and proof-read texts that have fallen into the public domain, with the goal of creating high quality ASCII text versions of the books. This is different from the large scale book-scanning projects mentioned earlier, which rely on institutional investment, and mainly focus on making the scanned images available. Sometimes, you can also get the OCRed text, but it has not been proof-read or quality controlled.While it&#039;s very neat to see pictures of old book pages, especially ones with elaborate illustrations, ASCII (or increasingly Unicode) text has many advantages. It can be searched and text-mined, copied and pasted into any format, and displayed on any kind of device - whether it&#039;s a text-to-speech device, an ebook reader, a cell phone, an eBook, or what have you. There are also several websites (like <a href=""http://manybooks.net/"">manybooks.net</a>) which repurpose these text files, for example by formatting them nicely, converting them to different ebook-reader formats, etc.I hadn&#039;t visited Project Gutenberg in years, but a friend of mine showed me that they have kept adding books, and in fact radically expanded their international offering. All of these languages have more than 50 titles available:     <a title=""Chinese (399)"" href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/zh"">Chinese</a> <a title=""Dutch (408)"" href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/nl"">Dutch</a> <a title=""English (23840)"" href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/en"">English</a> <a title=""Esperanto (56)"" href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/eo"">Esperanto</a> <a title=""Finnish (493)"" href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/fi"">Finnish</a> <a title=""French (1389)"" href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/fr"">French</a> <a title=""German (572)"" href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/de"">German</a> <a title=""Italian (184)"" href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/it"">Italian</a> <a title=""Latin (63)"" href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/la"">Latin</a> <a title=""Portuguese (311)"" href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/pt"">Portuguese</a> <a title=""Spanish (227)"" href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/es"">Spanish</a> <a title=""Swedish (51)"" href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/sv"">Swedish</a> <a title=""Tagalog (54)"" href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/tl"">Tagalog</a>, and there are many others that are represented with a few books.In addition, my friend showed me a few other sites that were in the same vein. <a href=""http://lib.ru"">lib.ru</a> has a huge collection of literature in Russian, in HTML format. You&#039;ll find your Dostoyevski and Gogol, but also <a href=""http://lib.ru/POECHIN/"">Russian translations of Chinese classics</a>, as well as <a href=""http://lib.ru/RUFANT/"">Soviet-era science fiction</a>! And in Japanese, <a href=""http://www.aozora.gr.jp/"">Aozora</a> has a huge collection of public domain works. And China is amazing at making material available, not caring too much about copyright - there is a plethora of sites where you can easily view the full text of any modern novel in HTML - <a href=""http://books.sina.com/"">books.sina.com</a> is an example.These resources are extremely useful, not least for me who is a learner (and I can&#039;t even speak Japanese, but perhaps one day). It means that I can download a Chinese book, and put it in Wenlin, or use an electronic mouse-over dictionary for the Russian texts. I&#039;d love to hear about interesting book collections in other languages.And then you have <a href=""http://librivox.org/"">LibriVox</a> - a collective of people who record public domain books, and release the audio books as public domain. I&#039;ve long been impressed by their work, and listened to a number of their books, and my friend pointed out that they&#039;ve now got more foreign content than ever. Their <a href=""http://librivox.org/multilingual-poetry-collection-001/"">multilingual poetry collections</a> are especially interesting.Stian",Language representation among DOAJ Open Access journals,"languages,open access,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/04/05/language-representation-among-doaj-open-access-journals/,"I am writing a paper about encouraging undergraduate students to conduct research in their mother tongues / other non-English languages that they know. One key element is of course availability -- University of Toronto students are lucky to have access to a large repository of foreign online journals, but this might not be the case everywhere, so Open Access can play an important role. Curious about this, and frustrated about the difficulty in finding good numbers about the size of the ""academosphere"" in different languages (how many journals are published in Spanish? In Farsi?), I decided to have a look at the <a href=""http://www.doaj.org"">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> data.Unfortunately, they don&#039;t provide an option to search based on language, but luckily they allow you to download their entire database of journal metadata as a comma-separated file. They have one field for journal language, but often there are several languages listed, so simply sorting them and counting in OpenOffice.org is not good enough. I whipped up <a href=""http://ruby.nopaste.dk/p865"">a quick Ruby script</a>, reusing a few lines from my <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/02/23/the-english-chinese-dictionary-revisited/"">previous script</a> to count the most frequent search-words used with my <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/02/16/release-early-release-often-english-chinese-dictionary-based-on-wikipedia/"">online Chinese-English dictionary</a>, and got the following list:<table border=""0""><tbody><tr><td>English</td><td>3309</td></tr><tr><td>Spanish</td><td>871</td></tr><tr><td>Portuguese</td><td>472</td></tr><tr><td>French</td><td>338</td></tr><tr><td>German</td><td>202</td></tr><tr><td>Italian</td><td>114</td></tr><tr><td>Turkish</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Croatian</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>Russian</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Catalan</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Japanese</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Polish</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Chinese</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Romanian</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Norwegian</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Swedish</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Czech</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Serbian</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Persian</td><td>10</td></tr></tbody></table>In total there were 4010 journals listed, but note that journals that have articles in several languages are double-counted, so a journal with articles in French and English would be counted as one journal for French, and one for English. (There are a total of 74 languages represented, the full list is <a href=""http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pNo-fF8ishiDei_QlgTmOfg"">here</a>).I am assuming (hoping) that there are more than 19 open access journals in Chinese, for example, but on the other hand, there might not be a strong incentive to be listed on an English-language only website, which does not even allow for searching/sorting by language. The data would have been better if we could have looked at the distribution at an article level, because some of the journals which list several languages are overwhelmingly published in only one of them -- however, only a portion of the journals have article data, and the article metadata does not contain a field for language (unlike journal metadata). I wonder if it would be feasible to run the titles through a language recognition library, but that has to be wait for another rainy day.Stian","yedigun => The following procedure may totally wreck iTunes.

"Digitized books on Aceh &#8211; but are they accessible to Acehnese?,"asia,books,libraries,open access,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/04/13/digitized-books-on-aceh-but-are-they-accessible-to-acehnese/,"[gallery columns=""2""]From <a href=""http://archiv.twoday.net/stories/5638233/"">Klaus Graf</a>, via <a href=""http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/04/oa-collection-of-books-about-aceh.html"">Open Access News</a>, The Royal Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (KITLV) in Leiden has digitized more than 656 books in their collection about Aceh, in several languages (Indonesian, French, Dutch, etc). Their website, <a href=""http://www.acehbooks.org/"">Aceh Books</a>. This is exciting news for me, since I have found it very hard to access Indonesian language books after returning from Jakarta. I have often wished that there were some serious book scanning projects started in Indonesia, because the country has a history of some excellent fiction, and of course there are many important social science and other non-fiction books as well, that are crucial to understand the history and culture of the country. However, these often exist in very few copies, so that even Indonesians in one part of Indonesia cannot access them, unless they travel thousands of kilometers to Jakarta or other centers.However, I am a bit concerned about how accessible these books are to Indonesians themselves. Part of the reason is that many libraries in Aceh were destroyed during the tsunami, and ideally people in Aceh would thus be able to access and read the books made available. However, currently they are only available as PDF-scans, the two books I tried were 60-80 MB downloads each. Having worked in Jakarta, I know that even in the best of circumstances, download speeds are extremely slow. In Jakarta, we spent a lot of money on a dedicated satellite connection, but it was still not fast - in the regional office in Tangerang, we shared an ISDN connection or similar, and even downloading e-mail was painfully slow.There are already good interfaces for presenting scanned books online - I&#039;ve previously written about Open Library (<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/02/google-books-step-aside-openlibrary-makes-reading-fun/"">1</a>, <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/08/03/openlibrary-and-universal-library-guys-work-together/"">2</a>, 3), and their interface, which only shows one page at a time, might be a good option (also, it would enable people to find the books more easily - rather than having to know about a specific page for Aceh-related books). Another possibility would be to upload them to a place like <a href=""http://www.scribd.com"">Scribd</a> as well, which ""streams"" PDFs. I haven&#039;t tested Scribd in a low-bandwidth environment, but I am assuming it would be far preferable to having to download 60MB. Of course, ideally, the books would be OCRed, and the text corrected by volunteers (or perhaps KITLV could pay some students in Aceh - Indonesian salaries are low), so that one could instead distribute text files weighing perhaps half a megabyte. (These can also be put on e-book readers, which would be important for me, if I wanted to read one of these in the future).It would also be nice if KITLV could specify the copyright conditions of these books - some of them are old enough to be public domain, but some seem newer - does KITLV have special agreements? Am I allowed to upload them to Scribd, or do other things with them?All in all, a great beginning, but hopefully these are questions they will think through - in collaboration with people on the ground in Aceh, who know far more than I do about what they need! I also keep hoping that some rich Indonesian (there are certainly enough of them!) will want their name immortalized through funding a large-scale book scanning project of the Indonesian heritage.Stian (in Hong Kong, going to Guangzhou and South China Normal University today)",Open Education &#8211; lecture in Chinese at South China Normal University,"china,events,open access,open-education,personal,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/04/27/open-education-lecture-in-chinese-at-south-china-normal-university/,"This summer, I am spending four months in China, and much of the time will be taken up with my research project (for my MA) on Chinese ""OpenCourseWare"" (I am gradually realizing that this is not an apt English translation of their program, but I need time to come up with a better one). In addition to my specific research plan, which includes interviewing people at three different universities, and someone at the Ministry of Education, I am very interested in meeting up with people knowledgeable about this area, and doing research on it.Coming up from Hong Kong to Beijing, I spent a few days at <a href=""http://former.scnu.edu.cn/eweb/"">South China Normal University</a>, where my advisor in Toronto had introduced me to some of his colleagues. They have a very strong group there in the department for educational technology, and a centre whose name I really love: <a href=""http://www.ferc.net"">Future Education Research Centre</a> (in Chinese). Not only were they some of the first to develop ""OpenCourseWare"" in China, but they also hold several research grants to research Chinese OpenCourseWare, one that compares it to OER in other countries, and one that looks at how to promote sustainability and reuse of OER.In addition, the centre meets every Thursday night for a seminar, and that week, I was invited to give a presentation about my own research, and some of my initial thoughts about the Chinese OCW situation. This was my first time to give a formal presentation in Chinese, which was both exciting and daunting. I was very happy about the opportunity, because it is a skill I wish to develop: One of my future dreams is to be able to teach in China - in Chinese. I know I&#039;m not there yet, but practice makes master.I used a lot of the material from <a href=""reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/16/open-education-around-the-world-presentation-at-oise/"">the presentation I gave at OISE</a> with Jim Slotta, so the <a href=""reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/12/links-from-the-talk-open-education-around-the-world/"">links page</a> for that talk would be useful for this talk as well.The <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/presentation-at-south-china-normal-university-16-april-2009"">slides for the talk </a>are on Slideshare, you might want to watch them while listening, since it&#039;s a very visual talk - sorry they are not synchronized.

I have in the past called for <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/11/10/theoretical-frameworks-for-researching-oer/"">the use of more theory when researching OER</a>, and part of the reason why that doesn&#039;t happen, is that many who are attending open education conferences in North America are not from schools of education, or have backgrounds in relevant fields. They are doing incredibly important work, and creating great innovations, but I keep wishing that more people within the field of education would begin studying this area (which is also why I this year presented on OER at <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/01/25/one-size-does-not-fit-all-a-case-study-of-the-spread-of-opencourseware-to-india-china-and-japan/"">CIES</a>, and at the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/16/open-education-panel-at-deans-graduate-conference/"">OISE Dean&#039;s Conference</a>).However, in China there is a huge amount of research on this happening at schools of education around the country. There are entire research centers focusing on Chinese OpenCourseWare, there&#039;s a journal called <a href=""http://www.shtvu.edu.cn/research/kaifang/main/main2.asp"">Open Education</a> (in Chinese). In addition, China has a very strong background in distance education, with it&#039;s <a href=""http://www.crtvu.edu.cn/English_crtvu/index_en.html"">massive TV and Radio University system</a>. That is not to say that all the research that is currently published is excellent - but I believe the potential is there. I hope more Chinese will reach out, translate their articles into English, write English blogs... but I also hope that the international community respect and support that. Provide travel grants for Chinese researchers to go to conferences, show an interest in their research and findings, look at the massive amount of OER available in Chinese, and consider translating some of this to English and use it with their own students, etc.Stian","New talk in Chinese: Understanding the meaning of open education, expanding the definition of OER | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] I never like to give the same talk twice, so although I reused some of the materials from my talk at South China Normal, I redesigned the talk quite a bit.

We went on Youtube and found several interviews of Cecilie, even a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0mJeINaW54"">documentary</a>, and saw that she was indeed really fluent in Cantonese, and also quite feisty.So when I was in HK for a few days this summer, on a whim I sent her an email and said, fellow Norwegian in town, would you care to meet up? And she got back to me saying, we&#039;re shooting a movie, care to dress up like a gangster and act ridiculous? Of course, that&#039;s one of my favorite things to do, so I was instantly in. The next two days, a bunch of gwailo spent hours practicing their Cantonese lines (I speak Mandarin, but not Cantonese - the others were better, but none as fluent as Cecilie), and running around in back alleys with big whigs and ketchup wounds, to the joy and befuddlement of the Hong Kong seniors sitting on benches and watching.

I decided to focus more on Open Access, since I think it&#039;s so important in China, and I also introduced <a href=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan Illich"">Ivan Illich</a> and deschooling society. In a country that is obsessed by formal education, and is currently undergoing probably the most rapid expansion of higher education that the world has ever seen, this might be seen as quite subversive.However, I was not on my pulpit preaching, rather I think his texts give us a lot of food for thought. And the fact that it was written in the 1970&#039;s reinforces my belief that the really difficult part with online learning - especially collaborative - is the ""software"", ie the social practices and structures, rather than the ""hardware"", ie. the technology.I got a fair number of good questions from the students after the talk. The talk went on for a bit over an hour, and we spent maybe an hour more discussing, after a small break. It&#039;s great to have that much time available to really probe something in-depth.In addition to Illich (whose books <a href=""http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Illich.html"">are available in full-text</a>, but sadly not <a href=""http://www.douban.com/subject/1997483/"">the Chinese translation</a>), I&#039;ve been reading up on different sociological theories on the value of schooling lately for a paper I was co-authoring, and found much that is extremely relevant to open education (especially in its more radical intonations).

Initiated by Beijing Normal University professor Zhuang Xiaoli (<a href=""http://sociallearnlab.org/blog/"">庄秀丽</a>), they run several very active mailing lists, wikis, and use a number of Chinese and international social networking apps. I am hoping do to an interview with professor Zhuang later, to talk more about the background for this organization. Anyway, while in Beijing I hoped to be able to meet up with people interested in these topics, and we managed to organize a ""salon"", with participants from several Beijing universities, as well as many students from Beijing Normal. I began by giving a ""short"" talk (I planned it for half an hour, but it became an hour), and then we had time after that to discuss and share.I posted the talk on Slideshare, with audio synched to the slides. This is my third talk that I have given in China, and they are all different (although some issues recur). In this case, I assumed that many of the people would be quite familiar with the basic issues, and I also knew from the mailing list that several had watched <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/05/25/new-talk-in-chinese-understanding-the-meaning-of-open-education-expanding-the-definition-of-oer/"">my earlier presentation at CMU</a>, so I decided to discuss some more detailed issues. I spent some time on talking about the progress in setting up <a href=""http://peer2peeruniversity.org"">Peer2Peer University</a>, and also discussed the open education blogosphere as an epistemic community, and compared my view of the Chinese and English-language ""spheres"". It turned out that many of the participants were not that familiar with many of the concepts however, and we spent some time after my talk to discuss things like open access, and open licenses, more in detail.<div id=""__ss_1512642"" style=""width: 425px; text-align: left;""><a style=""font:14px Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;display:block;margin:12px 0 3px 0;text-decoration:underline;"" title=""Social Learning - Presentation at SocialLearnLab (in Chinese)"" href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/social-learning-presentation-at-sociallearnlab-in-chinese?type=presentation"">Social Learning - Presentation at SocialLearnLab (in Chinese)</a><object width=""425"" height=""355"" data=""http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=social-learning-presentation-at-sociallearnlab-in-chinese-1906&amp;stripped_title=social-learning-presentation-at-sociallearnlab-in-chinese"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true"" /><param name=""allowScriptAccess"" value=""always"" /><param name=""src"" value=""http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=social-learning-presentation-at-sociallearnlab-in-chinese-1906&amp;stripped_title=social-learning-presentation-at-sociallearnlab-in-chinese"" /><param name=""allowfullscreen"" value=""true"" /></object><div style=""font-size: 11px; font-family: tahoma,arial; height: 26px; padding-top: 2px;"">View more <a style=""text-decoration:underline;"" href=""http://www.slideshare.net/"">presentations</a> from <a style=""text-decoration:underline;"" href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang"">houshuang</a>.</div></div>Stian",ant => good presentation:) i&#039;m loving it.. "PhD thesis on learning object reuse, and some ponderings","open-education,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/06/09/phd-thesis-on-learning-object-reuse-and-some-ponderings/,"I&#039;m stuck at Dubai airport for 12 hours, coming from Beijing, and transiting to Milan, where I will be attending <a href=""http://conferences.aepic.it/elpub2009/"">ElPub 2009</a> (and later <a href=""http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=48321"">OAI6</a> in Geneva). I could go downtown, but I&#039;ll be spending four days in Dubai on the way back, so it didn&#039;t seem worth it. The airport isn&#039;t that exciting, but it does have free wifi and occasional power-outlets, which is a huge plus.Via David Wiley&#039;s blog, I came across Sean Duncan&#039;s <a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/PatternsOfLearningObjectReuseInTheConnexionsRepository"">just completed dissertation</a> on the (lack of) reuse of learning objects, where he did a study of <a href=""http://cnx.org"">Connexions</a>. I grabbed the .doc from Archive.org, and since I didn&#039;t have any good movies left on my laptop, I settled down to read it in the airport.<strong>Digression about document formats</strong>A little digression here about document formats. For things that I am just going to be reading on screen, I find it annoying to download large .doc or .odt files. I seldom have Word of OO.org open, because I rarely use them (preferring tools like <a href=""http://www.literatureandlatte.com/"">Scrivener</a> for authoring, and OO.org for the final polish). Just starting Word slows my computer down, let alone opening a several-hundred page Word document. In these cases, when I am not expected to be editing the document, I much prefer PDFs. In fact, the first thing I did was to open the document in Word, convert it to PDF, open it in my PDF reader, and close Word. My PDF reader quickly opens many hundred page-PDF documents without even hesitating.On the other hand, PDFs are only good for one thing - seeing the document on the screen (or printing it), exactly as it were. Which excludes two important things: one is reformatting the document for nicer vieweing (or use on other devices), and the other is reuse. For example, I hate reading double-spaced documents (1.5 line spacing is tolerable), but in a PDF, there is no simple way to change this (in Word, it&#039;s extremely easy). I also remember borrowing my friend&#039;s <a href=""http://www.bookeen.com/"">CyBook</a> for a week, and got very frustrated when trying to read the book <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11309 - "">Opening up education</a> on it, which was released as a Creative Commons book, but only in PDF. Trying to display PDFs directly on the ebook is possible, but extremely awkward. Trying to extract the text gives poor results, with mixing of columns etc.And of course, for reuse, the situation is even worse... What&#039;s the point of applying a Creative Commons license that allows for reuse, if the text is ""trapped"" in a PDF, especially with a multi-column layout? And I realize that I do exactly this myself. I try to put many of my papers, reports, etc. online, with an open license. However, I always upload a PDF... So what&#039;s the alternative? .Doc and .odt? Both? I thought the idea of embedding an ODT into a <a href=""http://www.oooninja.com/2008/06/pdf-import-hybrid-odf-pdfs-extension-30.html"">""hybrid PDF""</a> sounded quite promising. Could we do the same, but embed an XML? DocBook? Markdown?<strong>Back to the dissertation</strong>So back to the actual contents. I have been very interested in the question of reuse (or even use) for a long time, since it often seemed like the open ed community was more focused on production than anything else, and especially reuse seemed to be something that most people wanted, but that was not very successful. Thus, Sean&#039;s topic is extremely timely.He starts out with a literature review, done in an interesting fashion. He uses a quite explicit methodology for gathering data: <em>""In the literature search for this study, the original search string [(SU ""learning objects"" or KW ""learning objects"") and (TX reuse OR reusable OR reusing OR ""re using"")], in the Academic Search Premier, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and PsychINFO databases, resulted in 43 records.""</em>He then drills further down, discarding non-peer reviewed papers and other non-relevant papers, and ends up with reviewing 25 articles in depth. I am curious about why he choose only these databases, and did not expand his search wider. For example, I ran the search <a href=""http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=%22learning+objects%22+AND+(%22reuse%22+OR+%22reusable%22+OR+%22reusing%22)&amp;btnG=Search"">""learning objects"" AND (""reuse"" OR ""reusable"" OR ""reusing"")</a> in Google Scholar, and it returned 9,280 hits. Granted, most of these will likely not be usable, but it seems probably that it would turn out more than 25 that were relevant to the topic in question.Where I really get confused however, is in the actual methodology and data collection part. He chooses to limit his study to Connexions, which has the advantage that all its content uses a free license, the system has built-in support for translation, modification and collaboration on modules, and the usage data is openly available. Modules in Connexions are basically articles, single text pieces, which can incorporate graphics etc. Collections can contain many modules.Sean defines the inclusion in a collection as use, in several collections as reuse, and also talks about translation and modification. He doesn&#039;t make a very strong case for why this would be valid, however. The first question is how Connexions is actually used - is it used mainly by self-learners, who wish to find useful material for their own studying? Or who want to study an entire ""collection""? Or is it used more by educators, who ""pre-package"" content for their students, into collections? Or are the collections made by some self-learners, who package stuff they find neat for other possible future users?I don&#039;t have the answer, but it seems like we would have to know a lot more about how Connexions is being used, to see if this mapping of statistical indicators to conceptual ideas ""work""... Sean has not referred to any of the literature on Connexions, although there are several articles <a href=""http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?q=connexions%20open%20education&amp;hl=en&amp;lr="">out there</a>. One weakness for example, is that he does not take into consideration reuse of specific modules from outside of Connexions. A simple example is <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/7089885/Lecture-1-Curriculum-Process"">this</a>, where a university curriculum explicitly refers to a specific Connexions module. The way I found this was through the Google search <a href=""http://www.google.ae/search?hl=ar&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=r9b&amp;q=link%3Acnx.org%2Fcontent+-site%3Acnx.org&amp;btnG=%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%AB!&amp;meta="">link:cnx.org/content -site:cnx.org</a>.<strong>How long should a PhD dissertation be?</strong>One of the things that struck me when opening the file, was how short the dissertation was. The PDF is 74 pages, and at first I thought that maybe it was single-spaced. But no, it is double-spaced, and in fact, there are a lot of appendices, so if we only count the text before the reference list, there&#039;s only 45 double-spaced pages in this PhD dissertation. Immediately that seemed very little to me. It might sound very superficial to focus on such an indicator, but it is striking, because it is so different... I recently looked over some literature from the <a href=""http://www.anu.edu"">Australian National University</a>, because my wife was thinking about attending, and in <a href=""http://rsh.anu.edu.au/graduate/pdfs_grad/Style_Guide.pdf"">their guidelines,</a> they specify that a PhD dissertation should be between 80,000-100,000 words. According to <a href=""http://www26.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=100000%20words"">Wolfram Alpha</a>, that gives about 400 double-spaced pages, ie. 10 times as much.Part of the reason that I am point this out, is that I think that this dissertation would have been much stronger if it had had a wider literature review, and perhaps even a design that combined qualitative and quantitative methods. It could first use exploratory qualitative methods to understand what constitutes reuse in the context of Connexions, and then use statistics to gauge the extent to which that is actually happening. It would also be great to look at, or even test, some different theories about why this might be the case or not. As it stands, I feel like the conclusion is not strong enough - it&#039;s telling us that there isn&#039;t that much reuse of learning objects within Connexions, but we&#039;re not sure why.All in all, it&#039;s an important topic, and it&#039;s great to see people picking up the gauntlet. I also know myself how hard it can be to venture into a research area that hasn&#039;t been much explored. I congratulate Sean on his achievements and hope he takes my thoughts in good spirit.Stian","celebryci => Interesting article. I am happy I found it.Its nice to read something interesting I cannot find RSS channel. Response to OER Reuse Dissertation  Open Education News => [...] 10, 2009 &middot; No Comments  Stian Haklev has posted a response to Sean Duncan&#8217;s dissertation regarding reuse in Connexions (reported by OEN). The [...]. Stian Håklev => Hi Marta,I certainly did email the author. Common courtesy. And also Wiley will be informed through an automatic trackback. It is certainly aimed at improving it, but in a certain sense it&#039;s ""too late"" for the PhD, in that it&#039;s already handed in... but of course, I hope he will continue this very important work in the future, and expand it. Stian. Marta => oh I see it now. this is not harsh criticism at all by the way. rather friendly and aimed at improving a lot of the thesis. do you think the author will ever see this? would you ever email him to tell him this outside the blog space?. "On critically engaging with other people&#8217;s writing,"open-education,personal,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/06/09/on-critically-engaging-with-other-peoples-writing/,"I just finished a blog post about Sean Duncan&#039;s PhD dissertation about reuse of learning objects, which was quite critical. And I asked myself for a second whether I should publish it or not. Would it make anyone upset (him, his supervisors)? Was it aggressive or uneccessary? I don&#039;t think so. I think part of the reasons I felt uneasy with publishing this, is because I am so used to ""haters"" and ""trolls"" on the internet, who will obsessively debate and criticize everything. In addition, while the fundament of academia is critical engagement and debate, there is certainly enough unproductive ""attacks"", personal disputes and other issues that don&#039;t serve to promote scholarship.However, just as Cory Doctorow is more afraid of obscurity than ebook-piracy, I think that obscurity or indifference is far worse than criticism in academia. If you have worked for years on a product, and it just ends up on a shelf in some library, never to be seen again... And I find this kind of thing happens frequently, at all levels. For example, I attended the <a href=""http://www.cies.us"">Comparative, International Education Society</a> annual meeting last year in Charleston, SC. This is a huge conference, with over 900 presentations given on all topics related to comparative education. Unfortunately, many of the presentations were extremely poor, but I felt that there was very little real engagement with the content, by the audience. Partly, this was probably due to the lack of time (often four 15 minute presentations, followed by just 20 minutes of discussion).The best session I attended was the presentation of a large project presented by several famous scholars, who had invited a who&#039;s who of famous education scholars to read drafts of their presentations before-hand, and give brief comments. One after another, they went up to the podium, and give extremely incisive and critical comments, with lot&#039;s of substance and deep insight. In a way, the presenters were being ripped to pieces in all kinds of ways, in another way they got the incredible privilege of having some of the best minds in the world engage deeply with their content. And I also wonder whether the fact that the presenters were also so established, and that everyone knew each other, was one reason why they could be so outspoken... they probably would not have done that to graduate students.Thinking about myself, I finished <a href=""http://eprints.rclis.org/archive/00014659/)"">my undergraduate honor&#039;s thesis</a> last year on community libraries in Indonesia. It was quite a novel topic, and I was very excited to put it together. I even had it translated to Indonesian, because I believed it was very important that those who were talked about, could also read (and criticize!) the paper. However, although I know that a number of people downloaded the PDF (and mysteriously, it even appeared on the shelves of the <a href=""http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4495338"">Australian National Library</a>), I have yet to receive any kind of substantial comment or criticism about the paper (which is very far from perfect!).Even blog posts are similar. I always wondered how some bloggers get so many comments on their posts. I know through statistics that there is a nice number of people visiting this blog, many finding it through Google queries, others reading it through feed-readers, etc. Yet, I get very few comments, and even when my blog posts are republished or linked to otherwise, it&#039;s usually just in a ""this is neat"" way. (There are exceptions, for example Downes did give me some<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/11/10/theoretical-frameworks-for-researching-oer/""> nice resistance</a><a href=""http://www.downes.ca/post/46921""> </a>about the role of theories in OER research).And added thing that sometimes strikes me is the whole hierarchy. What business do I have, as a first year MA student, to criticize the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/11/10/theoretical-frameworks-for-researching-oer/"">field of OER research</a>, or a PhD thesis? However, as long as you do it in a respectful and sincere manner, I think it is an important part of learning. I never pretend that what I say is the final truth, it is what I think. If it is completely wrong, then better that I say it out, and be corrected. For example, I mentioned that I thought the 45 page PhD thesis was very short. Perhaps this is quite normal, and I will be corrected. Great. Then I will have learnt something.I gave <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/06/04/talk-in-chinese-at-sociallearnlab-social-learning/"">a talk</a> two weeks ago for a Chinese community of people interested in open education and elearning, and one of the things I talked about was the English-language open ed blogosphere. I might have romanticized it a little bit, but I still believe it&#039;s one of the most helpful and constructive ""communities"" or networks that I&#039;ve ever engaged with. And one of the elements is that what you say really is much more important than who you are. Even if I am a first year MA student, if I have something interesting to say, people will read it. And although our education system is far from perfect, I treasure enormously the self-confidence of my teachers, almos consistently from primary school until my current MA, who welcome criticism and questioning, and encourage you to not accept things at face value.So I will continue poking my head out, but it works both ways - my stuff is out there, and I would love for people to tear it apart. Then I&#039;ll know, at least, that somebody&#039;s read it.Stian","Xenia => Since you took the time to read a post on my (German!) blog and didn&#039;t critizise me at all, let me suggest, that the quantity of criticism does not nessecerily correlate with the quality of the content of a text. Still, I agree, criticism is a strong driving force in intellectual endeavors. But I wouldn&#039;t take this fallibilistic view to far. I think one reason some blogs have more comments is that they serve a different function. For instance, I often don&#039;t comment on blogs, because I feel self-conscious about my English writing. (I&#039;m working on that as you see ; -) That doesn&#039;t make me a less engaged and critical reader.. Danny Fekete => (Now that you&#039;ve deleted the spam, it looks like I&#039;m referring to other legitimate commenters.  Good, good.). Danny Fekete => Hoya, Stian.  Looks like Akismet missed a couple of goons.As impact-factor metrics become more sophisticated and sensitive to online publication, it seems to me that systematic criticism could be ""popularized"" by increasing the impact of the criticized author and ameliorating ego-bruising.  There could be safeguards to predict and reward validity, and to take into account the difference of career maturity between the publisher and the reviewer.Though, the fact that I&#039;m suggesting this probably means that it&#039;s already been thought of, developed, implemented, and discredited by now.. Michael C. Harris => Criticism is scary to give and scary to receive for most people, but the fact that you stopped and thought about it meant that you were right to deliver it. Your criticism of Sean&#039;s work was balanced and obviously well intentioned. The hierarchy matters not a jot.Of course, that&#039;s all in an ideal world. There will always be people who can&#039;t handle criticism, even if it&#039;s accurate and delivered well :)Oh, and as for length, my thesis (in Australia) is expected to be around 80,000 to 100,000 words, not including appendices.. Stian Håklev => Marta, I see that you found it later. Yeah, there was a lot more substantial stuff. But the length is interesting, because what exactly _is_ required to get a PhD? and how is a PhD different from an MA? or a BA honors thesis? Especially since requirements can wary so much from country to country - in Canada it typically takes something like 4 + 2 + 4-5 years (10-11 years in total) to get a PhD, whereas in Australia, it seems like you can do it in 6-7 (3+3-4)... If you look at my previous post, however, Ali, you will see that I pointed out a number of things that I would like to have seen expanded. And yes, I really think it is very hard to cover the depth of material required for a great PhD thesis in 45 double-spaced pages. Not saying it&#039;s impossible (especially in the sciences I guess, harder in the humanities)... But setting hard page requirements is tough, and it will get more difficult as we start embracing new forms of publishing... Many programs ask for articles instead... in the future, will a PhD be a wiki, a blog, a number of Twitter entries, a 15 minute documentary, and an audiobook? :) Thanks all for chiming in!Stian, just arrived in Milan. Marta => So one thing I didn&#039;t get - have you published that criticism of that PhD thesis in the end? Is the 45 pages length the only criticism? You can do so much better than that ;) I think 45 pages is outrageous - a Ba thesis yes, an MA thesis perhaps but not a PhD. If someone babbles for 300 pages in their PhD that just means they missed the point of having this amount of space to make a meaningful contribution. Usually the problem is how to shorten the document, because while you do research, there is just so much that needs to be said and so little space. As to why I sometimes don&#039;t leave you comments - maybe because I prefer to talk to you directly on gchat :). Zaid => Hi Stian,First of all, you are Norwegian, and all Norwegians are brilliant whether they are black, white, red or blue (which fallacy did I just commit) :)Seriously, I think you are brilliant, and when you write you explore issues in many angles making it very difficult to tear you apart. So, ordinary dudes like me don&#039;t know where to challenge, while super dudes (besides Downes) have little time (although they might read your posts) to tear them apart unless you challenge them or their ideas directly with some venom based on juicy facts :)For example, just write a post (with some flavor) entitled ""David Wiley you are damn wrong!"", and trust me you will get tons of replies :)But then again if you don&#039;t get many comments on your blog, does not mean that your posts are not being challenged or appreciated elsewhere.For example, I don&#039;t get many comments either, but I have come to discover that many of my posts are being shared and talked about here and there in other blogs/sites and retweeted on Twitter quite often.But as people continue to discover you (and your ideas) and you challenge other educators on their blog (comments), I believe comments will increase and eventually your ideas will be torn apart.For example, you statement, ""...I thought the 45 page PhD thesis was very short."" is such a rubbish and poor argument :)Why is a 45-page PhD thesis very short? Is it short, because most other PhD thesis babble for 200 pages, when they could perhaps have made their argument in 5 to 10 pages. What has the length of a paper to do with getting a PhD or fulfilling the requirements of a PhD thesis? Do I have to write more than 50,000 words (some places a requirement), if I could do it in 10,000 words? Could I get a PhD writing just 5 pages? What is really the objective of a PhD anyway? I suppose one can tear apart what I just said :)Have a great day discovering and learning :)Warm Regards,Zaid. Turadg => I concur, Stian.  And I think it&#039;s important that we provide feedback to each other even when we don&#039;t have anything interesting to add, such as this comment I&#039;m making.  :).

I remember emailing him during last Open Education conference, saying that I had seen him on the pre-conference wiki, and was excited to be meeting him, and he wrote back that unfortunately he wouldn&#039;t be attending anyway.Funnily enough, this year, he did come to the <a href=""http://openedconference.org/"">Open Education conference</a> in Vancouver, and I did see him, but he always seemed busily engaged with very interesting people, so I never got chance to introduce myself (never took the chance, anyway). The Open Ed conferences are often like that - everyone are busily trying to reconnect with people, or meet with people they have read or communicated with, it&#039;s like a social dance.However, thanks to the beauty of the internet, we finally got connected, Leigh had a look at some of my stuff, and he invited me to have a conversation about some of the ideas we are both thinking about.

One of the ideas discussed is that if you try to bring Creative Commons to a context where copyright generally isn&#039;t well respected, you first have to teach them to respect copyright.(Indeed, it&#039;s funny, even myself - I shamelessly pirate, and often steal non-open content, but if something is marked as CC ND, I&#039;d never edit it).To many people, this is problematic, since they are very skeptical to the idea of copyright at all, especially of imposing it on other cultures. (These countries might already have signed on to international treaties that import the legal frameworks, but this might not have done much to affect practice). I&#039;ve been very sympathetic to this line of thought, and curious about how to resolve this problem.On the one hand, there is a lot of great material being released ""openly"" in for example <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/12/05/worlds-largest-university-opens-almost-all-its-materials/"">India</a>, <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/19/407-indonesian-textbooks-openly-available/"">Indonesia</a> and <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/01/25/global-concept-local-practices-state-of-the-research-on-ocw-in-chinese/"">China</a>, but none of this material uses an open license, and I would really love if it could. On the other hand, I don&#039;t want to try to force some kind of a North-American copyright system on these countries. I tried repeatedly to discuss this distinction with academics in China, but nobody seemed very interested, which was funny.This came up during my <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/08/27/conversation-with-leigh-blackall/"">conversation</a> with Leigh Blackall today, when he asked me whether there was a culture of sharing in China already. I replied that it was more a culture of taking, ie. people would be happy to download movies, pirate movies, and take ""open educational resources"", that didn&#039;t have an open license. But I would argue that taking is very different from sharing. Sharing is having the person who created the resource encourage people to take it, and facilitate that. For me, that is one of the most important roles of Creative Commons licenses - not the legal part.Because as I wrote on Leigh&#039;s blog, I can&#039;t imagine ever suing anyone for abusing my license, and I certainly don&#039;t care if people credit me or not. But by putting a CC license on your material, you tell the world: Yes, this is my gift to you. Take it, please, send it along, enjoy it, have fun with it, and make some stuff yourself to share as well. As I explained to Leigh, when I published a poetry collection with some friends as a 16 year old, we imitated grown ups and put a big Copyright warning on the first page - even though we made no money (nor did we try to), and would have been extremely honored if more people were interested in reading our book. We just hadn&#039;t thought about it - it was the thing to do, when publishing a book.Similar with the Super Notepad program i wrote in Visual Basic 3, I released it as postcard-ware. It&#039;s not like I had any interest in hoarding the source code, but I just didn&#039;t think about making it open source, because I didn&#039;t know there was such a thing. But kids these days do. And when I am giving talks about openness and peer-creation, I don&#039;t talk about obscure legal stuff, I show them <a href=""http://ccmixter.org"">ccMixter</a>, mashups, Wikipedia articles progressing through time...So rather than the Chinese and Indian institutions necessarily embracing a specific kind of a copyright license (although there would be certain advantages to that too, from my Western standpoint of someone who wants to reuse their resources), what I most want is for them to actively share their materials, and invite people to reuse them. Implicit in this is to publish the material in an open format - it&#039;s very hard to translate your textbook when it&#039;s in a PDF!So during my talk with Leigh it struck me - perhaps we should separate the happy symbol from the legalese, and create a new logo to put on webpages and books, that had no legal significance at all (because as Leigh pointed out, even Public Domain signifies that there is other stuff that is not PD), but which simply says ""I actively want to share this material with you, and I encourage you to use it and pass it on. Like a big flower or a sun, or something hippieish...This is just me thinking aloud. I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s necessarily a bad thing to have copyright - those who believe CC BY Share-Alike is the most open license will not agree, because their share-alike is only protected by copyright - if copyright isn&#039;t respected, Share-alike won&#039;t be either. But it&#039;s an interesting idea, and it was a useful mental exercise for me at least, to separate the legal functions of CC, and the community building, or norming function, which I think iCommons, the iSummits (RIP), ccLearn and all of Lessig&#039;s talks have done so well.Stian<strong>Update</strong>: I just came back from a nice walk, with these ideas ruminating in my mind. I was thinking about the different between software and cultural creations, and how that might play out differently in licenses - especially related to my last statement that Share-alike fans might not like to abolish copyright.The difference is access. Richard Stallmann&#039;s initial problem with printer drivers or what it was, wasn&#039;t about someone prohibiting him from releasing modified copies, it was about getting access to the source code at all... And today in developing countries, of course they can pirate software, but they can&#039;t do anything meaningful with it - only make verbatim copies. Whereas with culture, as long as we keep breaking all their DRM, we have full access to anything that is copyrighted. We can mashup their movies, write fanfic about Harry Potter, and ""liberate"" toll-access academic journals...All we need is for someone to be able to access the material. And in fact, even a share-alike license doesn&#039;t require anyone to make material accessible... So maybe this is the difference, which makes a GPL license really necessary for software, to ""force"" people to release the source code, but which makes a ""pirate as you go"" approach viable for culture? (Although I do hate those PDFs...).Thinking aloud again...","Leigh Blackall => Bang on! Especially the update. We are so swamped in copyright thinking that it is another interesting exercise to try and talk about all this without even mentioning copyright. For me so far, it is about elevating the topic to the realm of morals, ethics and principles.. and saying ""we don&#039;t need a legal framework to help us with that, it is inbuilt if we just let go for long enough"".. Its impractical in this material world, I know.. and it makes me sad to realise that taking, giving and sharing has become possible for many of us, only by way of a legal hack. I visited Malaysia a while back.. bought a stack of pirate DVDs. It amazed me the sophistication of the selling, which considering the legal risk they take on (having to hide their shops and even acknowledge their business as ""crime""), and the relative cost of the products I was buying.. it IS a form of giving. Sure they are making money, that&#039;s ok.. all that is is me giving them a little in return for their time and materials. I would just as sooner by the DVDs from the original creators if they were only willing to compete with the reduced cost set by the copiers, but they&#039;re not! They charge stupid amounts - encouraging me to want cheaper versions.. which we get when visiting Malaysia, or a Bit Torrent download.I&#039;d really like to spend some time looking at the real use, reuse, give, take, copy, share, buy, sell and remix of cultural products free of legal regulations for a bit. If we did ignore the regulations for just a little while, we might come to see a fresh new way of considering the economics of it all, and discover sound new business models, and rediscover our humanity for each other.. "Comparative Education Review partially opens peer-review,"media,open access,personal,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/08/30/comparative-education-review-partially-opens-peer-review/,"The electronic publishing and the Open Access movement has led to many different experiments with academic journals. One idea that I found quite interesting is ""open peer review"" (the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review"">Wikipedia article</a> is a good overview). Open peer review could simply mean that the author knows the names of the reviewers, which is not very interesting to me. What is much more interesting is when the journal publishes not only the final revised and copy-edited version, but also all the intermediary steps, including the communication between the reviewers and the author. These two versions of open peer review could be combined, but they don&#039;t have to be - one could still open up the communication to the world after publication, without revealing the names of the peer reviewers.I&#039;ve always thought this was a very exciting idea, because it allows you a peek into the process of publishing, and can be very helpful when you are yourself beginning to write for publication. I think this is especially true for beginning scholars who do not receive as much support from colleagues or mentors - for example graduate students who are not at top institutions, or researchers in the developing world who want to publish in English. Publishing is a mysterious process, and opening it up to see that even the greats in the field had to go through several rounds of editing can be very confidence building. (In a similar vein, Gans and Shepherd <a href=""http://econpapers.repec.org/article/aeajecper/v_3a8_3ay_3a1994_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a165-79.htm"">interviewed famous economists</a> about their histories of being rejected).However, so far I believe it the only journals experimenting with this have been in the STEM fields, and the things they tend to comment on - statistical significance and so on - are very different from picking apart an argument in a political science or anthropology text. It would be great if some journals in the social sciences and humanities would also agree to open their peer review process.This summer, I submitted a number of manuscripts to various journals. This is the first time I have submitted papers to real journals (I submitted one to an undergraduate journal when I was doing my BA). I got three papers accepted (one a multi-authored one), and three rejections (two papers, and one conference submission). However, I was quite inspired by the rejections, because they were all very ""good"" rejections: in all cases, the editor or the peer-reviewers had engaged deeply with my material, and gave insightful and (mostly) useful comments.<a href=""http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/cer/current""><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/na101/home/literatum/publisher/uchicago/journals/covergifs/cer/cover.jpg"" alt="""" width=""81"" height=""109"" />Comparative Education Review</a> is the flagship journal of the <a href=""http://cies.us/"">Comparative International Education Society</a> (CIES), an organization that also holds a large annual conference with several thousand attendees. It&#039;s also considered one of the most prestigious journals in the comparative education field, and I got a chance to listen to some of their editors during their last annual meeting. Although extremely selective, what impressed me was their commitment to providing very good feedback, even for papers that were not accepted. So although I did not have high hopes that they would accept my paper, I submitted it to them this summer.I received it back, rejected by the editor, who did not think it was good enough to be forwarded to the peer reviewers. But he wrote a page long very good critique of the paper - much more than I received in my graduate school, where I got an A and a ""good job""... I wrote back to thank him for the thoughtful critique, and also suggested that it would be very useful for others if they made, not necessarily all (I didn&#039;t want to be too bold), but a selection of their articles ""open peer review"".To my surprise, <a href=""http://www.ed.psu.edu/educ/cshe/people/david-post-ph-d"">Dr. David Post</a> (the editor who had reviewed my paper) wrote back and said that he very much liked the idea, and that they would produce a document containing the full correspondence of past papers. I recently contacted him again to see if something had happened, and lo and behold: on their website, they currently host a 369 page <a href=""http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/userimages/ContentEditor/1250888208942/CER_samples.pdf"">document</a> containing the communication between the author, editor and peer-reviewers concerning 35 different articles between 2003 to 2009. This is a selection that makes up about 1.5 years worth of the journal, which I suppose is based on the subset of authors and reviewers that agreed to have these documents made public.This is how Dr. Post introduces the document on the <a href=""http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/page/cer/samples.html"">CER website</a>:<blockquote>To provide examples of reviews and of the CER editors&#039; responses, we selected about one-third of the articles published over the past five years, choosing a variety of styles, methods, disciplinary orientations, and geographic areas. We are grateful to the authors we selected for allowing this open access to their files, especially since (without exception) all files contain critical suggestions and request further improvement. The authors&#039; willingness to participate speaks volumes about their security as scholars. The CER has been publishing less than 15 percent of submissions in recent years, and all the articles represented here have gone through multiple revisions, as part of the review process, before they were developed enough for acceptance.</blockquote>Having a quick look through the document, I see several author names that I recognize - people who are intellectual leaders in the community. As Dr. Post says, it is very generous of them to give us some insight into not only their finished published articles, but the struggles they had with getting them published (some articles were revised 4 times).Of course, CER has not changed to open peer review, and in that sense, the title of this blog post might be slightly misleading. This collection was based on previously published material, and this is not a policy for articles going forward, nor are there, as far as I understand, any plans for producing follow up volumes. However, I still think this is a very brave move by one of the leaders in its discipline, and perhaps other journals will be inspired to follow. We are hoping to start a article writing group at my school this year, for students who want to begin submitting papers to collaborate, share ideas and critique each others work, and I think using this document can be very valuable for that project.Thank you, CER!Stian<blockquote></blockquote>","Espen => Interesting. I wonder if most journals simply don&#039;t think about this, and for that reason don&#039;t do it. At the face of it, at least, all it took in this case was for you to suggsest it to the editor. .

This teachers work at the different cram schools, and their lessons are also filmed and made available online for a subscription fee. Some of these teachers have become virtual superstars, making more than $10 million per year, and having their lessons viewed by more people than the most popular soap operas. This is of course related to the academic culture in Korea, where there is a very strong focus on math and natural science, and an enormous pressure to perform well on various entrance exams. It would be interesting to know whether they only produce video, or also much more integrated and interactive websites, and discuss the pedagogy of different media. It would also be interesting to understand more about what makes these lessons so attractive to students, and effective -- too bad I cannot understand Korean.I wonder what impact this phenomenon will have on various OER projects - would teachers be as willing to publish their materials free of charge, if they thought they could make a lot of money by selling them? Of course, the people in the newsreport are not necessarily representative for teachers. The <a href=""http://www.kocw.net/index.html"">various OCW projects in Korea</a> seem to be thriving and growing. I wonder if there are any high school students that use OCW videos when cramming for exams, that would be an interesting study, and a great example of a setting where effective OER is needed, and where accreditation is not an issue.Stian",Jay => This is absolutely amazing. I totally can see how this would work out. Viral videos sometimes go through the roof in unique visitors.  Keep up the good work.

In this article, he finds that very few articles currently contain links to OA articles, and that we should make a real effort to link to these, since they provide jump-off points for people who want to research a topic more in-depth, and are more useful than references to closed articles, or physical books, because they are available to anyone online. I thought it was a great idea at the time. Whenever I talk about open educational resources, I also mention OA research as an important source of information, and I hope that the OER movement and the OA movement can work even more together in the future.<img title=""Link to open video lecture"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Screen-shot-2009-10-25-at-11.51.26-PM-300x48.png"" alt=""Link to open video lecture"" width=""300"" height=""48"" />Recently, I came across another very interesting Wikipedia project. The user <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:EconoPhysicist"">EconoPhysicist</a> writes on his userpage: <em>""Many of my contributions have been related to the <a title=""OpenCourseWare"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCourseWare"">OpenCourseWare</a> movement, initiatives by universities to make video and other course materials freely available on the web."" </em>Starting in January this year, EconoPhysicist has made more than 350 edits, almost all of them adding open educational videos from universities to relevant articles. Users who go to to the articles for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation"">Euler&ndash;Lagrange equation</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_network"">Flow network</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_America"">Democracy in America</a> can find at the bottom a link to relevant videolectures from Yale, MIT, Stanford and other universities that make their lectures available in this way.<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-402"" title=""Articles that have gotten open lecture videos added"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Screen-shot-2009-10-25-at-11.52.31-PM.png"" alt=""Articles that have gotten open lecture videos added"" width=""430"" height=""188"" />I think this is a brilliant initiative! It&#039;s a great way to improve the ""findability"" of these resources, and contributes to demolish the idea that Wikipedia is not suitable to education. The point is of course (and has always been) that you don&#039;t stop at the Wikipedia article, you <strong>start</strong> from it. During my talk last week, we discussed the problem with having OCW materials ""siloed"" off in separate institutional sites, rather than aggregated, and I pointed out that the open nature of these materials means that even if MIT or Stanford themselves haven&#039;t created interesting ways to access and aggregate their materials - other users can. So you can have websites like <a href=""http://videolectures.net/"">Videolectures.net</a>, which aggregate lecture videos and provide Web 2.0 features, you can link resources to Wikipedia, you can create <a href=""http://p2pu.org/Afforestation-Syllabus"">open curricula</a> that include links to lecture videos, etc.It would be really useful if it was easier to link to a specific segment in a video, or to easily choose a video, trim it, and upload it to Wikimedia Commons (although most of the videos are non-commercial, which means that they could not be included in Wikipedia, only linked to). It might also make sense to make a series of shorter videos, rather than one long one - it would make reuse much more feasible.I wish Wikipedia&#039;s in other languages would take up the challenge - there is lot&#039;s of great OCW material in <a href=""http://www.jocw.jp/"">Japan</a>, <a href=""http://www.kocw.net/home/en/index.do"">Korea</a>, <a href=""http://openedconference.org/archives/511"">China,</a> <a href=""http://ocw.itesm.mx/index.php?lang=us"">Mexico</a>, and <a href=""http://www.ocwconsortium.org/use/use-dynamic.html"">many other languages</a>.Stian","Using Wikipedia to Find OCW  => [...] 26, 2009 &middot; Leave a Comment  Stian Haklev has a new post discussing an effort to include links in Wikipedia to OCW.

"The ethical review process for social science research,"canada,Education,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/10/28/the-ethical-review-process-for-social-science-research/,"I just finished reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/My-Freshman-Year-Professor-Becoming/dp/0801443970"">""My freshman year""</a>, an ethnographic book about a professor enrolling as a student at her own university, and spending a year living in the dormitory, to try to understand why she feels so disconnected from the contemporary student culture. The book was published under the pseudonym Rebekah Nathan, but a journalist in the New York Sun was able to piece together her real identity - <a href=""http://home.nau.edu/sbs/anthro/faculty/small.asp"">Cathy Small</a> from <a href=""http://www.nau.edu/"">Northern Arizona University</a>. The book is quite short, and although she does quote from national surveys and some previous research, it&#039;s written in a very popular voice, with very little theory.For various reasons, the book made me think of a lot of different topics. It made me think of many other ethnographic studies that I read during my undergrad, and how I often had the feeling: ""is this all you came up with?"" The book has some interesting points, but it still seems little after a year of immersing oneself in a community - furthermore a community of which she already had some knowledge. From her own comments, it seems that she decided not to use a large amount of her collected materials, because of concern with ethics.<strong>Ethics</strong><img class=""alignright"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://minerva.stkate.edu/offices/administrative/orsp.nsf/files/logo/$file/irb_logo.jpg"" alt="""" width=""200"" height=""208"" />Which leads me to the question of research ethics, which is something I have thought a lot about recently - not the least having had to go through the Ethical Review Board protocol myself for my field work in China. I was curious to see how the ethics of her fieldwork was received, and I found a long - and quite vitriolic - debate in the comment field under <a href=""http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/07/13/frosh"">an article</a> by Inside Higher Ed. Most of the people on the list had not yet read the book - nor did they know (until towards the end of the comment thread) her real identity. Most readers were appalled at her use of deception (not telling the other students that she was doing research), although she did use informed consent for her formal interviews, and her IRB approved of the research.One of the things that surprised me was that she chose to do the research at her own campus. It might have been closer to home, and easier to organize from the university, but it seems to make things much more complicated. I am surprised that she wasn&#039;t recognized more, for a university with only 10,000 students, although from what she describes, it&#039;s very large and dispersed, and perhaps the anthropologi professors just drive to the anthro building, and stay there. If she had been at UofT Scarborough, she would have ran into colleagues all the time. In addition, it is much easier to discover which university she talked about, and she will probably run into students she lived with (especially since they were freshman, and had three years left), maybe even teach some of them, or meet them in other capacities.I failed to find any serious discussion about the ethics of her approach (the debate mentioned above was high on temper, low on facts), which would have been interesting - but clearly it worked out, since she is not only still in her job, but also has been travelling around and lecturing about the student experience.I think that the demand for anonymity, for example, sometimes goes too far -- or is unworkable. I remember another example of a student at my school who was working as a teacher (many of our students are part-time, mid-career). She wrote her thesis on the process of internationalizing the curriculum at her school. She would change the name of the school, but of course, everyone could google her and find out where she lived -- and anyone involved at that school could look up her thesis, and that is probably what&#039;s the most relevant. Another recent example is a student who just defended her PhD thesis, and presented on it in our class (taught by her supervisor). She discussed the policies toward internationalization by two different universities, one in Ontario and one in British Columbia. According to her supervisor: ""We all understand that this refers to X and Y university, because of their characteristics, but for ethical reasons, we couldn&#039;t name them in the thesis"". What ethical reasons, if anyone familiar with the Canadian context can immediately deduce which universities are in question?I guess my biggest problem with elaborate ERB protocols is that they do exactly the opposite of what they are supposed to do: incite debate, reflection and continued care. Instead, with their 20 page protocols that take months to get through, people focus on writing to get approved, not daring to take chances with new research methods, for example, because it might delay their project for too long. Instead of allowing you to go to a new country, spend time understanding the situation deeper, and then modifying your research plan accordingly, it binds you to a rigid structure, or forces you to go through months waiting to have the new proposal approved. It would be interesting with studies of how people have modified their research designs to be ""safe"", to not challenge the review board, because they cannot risk having their approval delayed. I&#039;d also like to know about the implementation of the ethics requirements across Canada, I know they are based on the tri-councils who fund research in Canada, but it would be interesting to look at how interpretation and execution differs across institutions.In January this year, University Affairs <a href=""http://www.universityaffairs.ca/major-changes-proposed-for-research-that-involves-humans.aspx"">reported</a> that there were changes afoot to make the ethics process more responsive to the concern of social science researchers, whereas it traditionally has been very much oriented towards the biomedical sciences and their concerns. It will be interesting to see the changes, and how quickly they trickle down to the institutional level.Stian<em>Picture from <a href=""http://minerva.stkate.edu/offices/administrative/orsp.nsf"">Office of Research and Sponsored Programs</a>, St. Catherine University.</em>",Identity rap from Norwegian-Egyptian,"europe,media,personal,politics,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/10/28/identity-rap-from-norwegian-egyptian/,"<img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" title=""KarpeDiem"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/KarpeDiem.jpg"" alt=""KarpeDiem"" width=""250"" height=""317"" />As I was walking home tonight, I listened to <a href=""http://www.nrk.no/migrapolis/"">Migrapolis</a> on my iPod.

"Creating a &#8220;dictionary&#8221; from KDE translation files,"languages,open access,opensource,personal,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/11/01/creating-a-dictionary-from-kde-translation-files/,"I&#039;ve previously written about how I used interwiki links in Wikipedia to extract dictionary information (<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/02/16/release-early-release-often-english-chinese-dictionary-based-on-wikipedia/"">here</a> and <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/02/23/the-english-chinese-dictionary-revisited/"">here</a>). After talking with a friend, I got another idea for how I could extract even more dictionary information - localization files. You might know that open source projects like KDE are available in many different languages, translated by (usually) volunteers. In order to make translation easy, and enable volunteers who might not know anything about programming to help out, the text strings to be translated are extracted from the source code, and translated in separate files, often using a library called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext"">gettext</a>.Given that there are these large databases of strings translated into different languages out there, I wondered if I could use that as an addition to a dictionary. I am pretty sure I am not the first to have this idea, in fact, I seem to remember some website where you could search translation strings, but I don&#039;t remember where I found that. Anyway, I decided to give it a try. First I had to find the files. I began by downloading some Debian localization packages, but then remembered that in the finished product, the files (with .mo extension) have been ""compiled"", so that the program can access them more rapidly, and are not plain text anymore. There might be tools that can extract the strings from the .mo files, but it&#039;s much easier to go straight to the ""source"", and get the localization projects from the SVN repository.KDE has very nice and helpful pages for their translation teams, for example <a href=""http://l10n.kde.org/team-infos.php?teamcode=zh_CN"">the page for simplified Chinese</a> tells me clearly how I should go about to download this project, simply enter the command:<pre><code>svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/l10n-kde4/zh_CN/messages</code></pre>and a bit over a thousand files will be downloaded, with names like koffice/kivio.po. After some initial metadata, these files look like this:<pre><code>#: rc.cpp:28msgctxt ""Stencils""msgid ""Assorted""msgstr ""杂类""#: rc.cpp:29msgctxt ""Stencils""msgid ""Electric""msgstr ""电子""#: rc.cpp:30msgctxt ""Stencils""msgid ""Network""msgstr ""网络""</code></pre>There is some metadata about where in the code this string comes from, then the key string in English, which will be the same in all translation projects, and then the translation into Chinese. If all we wanted was an English-Chinese dictionary, it would be quite easy to run some <a href=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Regexp"">regexp</a>s to compile this data. However, we would like to make a dictionary of for example Norwegian and Chinese. The corresponding Norwegian file looks like this:<pre><code>#: rc.cpp:28msgctxt ""Stencils""msgid ""Assorted""msgstr ""Diverse""#: rc.cpp:29msgctxt ""Stencils""msgid ""Electric""msgstr ""Elektrisk""#: rc.cpp:30msgctxt ""Stencils""msgid ""Network""msgstr ""Nettverk""</code></pre>So I wrote a simple program that takes two paths, and opens every file in those two paths, and you can download that script <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/extract.rb"">here</a>. If you download the Chinese files into a directory called zh, and the Norwegian files into a directory called no, you can run the program like this:<pre><code>ruby extract.rb no/messages zh/messages &gt; nozh.data</code></pre>and you get a file containing more than a 100,000 lines like this:<table border=""0""><tbody><tr><td>Lydstyrke</td><td>音量</td></tr><tr><td>Tone inn/ut-kurve</td><td>曲线淡出</td></tr><tr><td>Tone til volum</td><td>淡出到音量</td></tr><tr><td>Tonetid</td><td>淡出时间</td></tr><tr><td>Start toning</td><td>开始淡出</td></tr></tbody></table>...which is what we were looking for. You can then easily grep this file to find words you are looking for - many of which won&#039;t be in normal dictionaries (especially not Chinese-Norwegian or Esperanto-Urdu or whatever interesting combinations you cook up).This script can be used for any language combinations, with one caveat. Right now, it is hardcoded to only accept entries that contain at least one Chinese character from the second file, because there is now point to get an entry telling you that XML in Norwegian is XML in Chinese. I do that by adding this:<pre><code>trans[0][0] =~ /[⾰-⾿]/</pre></code>which is a regular expression that checks for the existence of Chinese characters. You&#039;d want to remove that, if you were not using it with Chinese.StianPS: I realize that calling this a ""dictionary"" is perhaps not very accurate, they are collocated sentences, not words. However, if the target language is a language that you speak a bit of, you can very often easily isolate the word you are looking for.","johnfisherman => Check this out:  <a href=""http://www.fredrocha.net/MemeMiner"" target=""_blank"">http://www.fredrocha.net/MemeMiner</a>  ;) .

I got the honor of starting off with the first event (although I believe there was one event the week before), with a presentation about Innovative projects in the publishing of OER. I&#039;ve always been interested in how different institutions and countries around the world approach the production of OER, and have given presentations in the past about the incredible wealth and diversity and projects out there. In these presentations (linked from my <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/publications-and-presentations"">presentations</a> page), I usually discuss the projects from a resource perspective - what is out there, and how can we use it.

So I&#039;m in our little apartment in Beijing trying to clean up before my wife comes back, and put on a collection of Norwegian 60&#039;s music which I have downloaded. The first song is cute, the story of some woman living on a little conservative place in Norway, and getting called to church by the ""council for high moral"", because she was wearing too low-cut dresses. But she ends up teaching them all a lesson.I thought the song was cute, so I wanted to know more. I googled a line of the song, and found out that it was called Fru Johnsen (Mrs. Johnsen), and was written by Terje Mosnes and performed by the still famous Anne Lise Rypdal in 1967. Apparently it caused enough consternation that it was for a period banned from playing on the national broadcaster (lyric <a href=""http://forumromanum.vgb.no/2008/02/26/jeg-horte-mamma-sla-ihjel-tilsynet-for-hog-moral/"">here</a>, video <a href=""http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=18360984"">here</a>).<img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://www.nelsonriddlemusic.com/nr_tv_harper.gif"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""250"" />However, this song wasn&#039;t original - in fact, it was an adaptation of a very well-known American country song called ""Harper Valley PTA"" (<a href=""en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_Valley_PTA "">Wikipedia entry</a>). This song was written by Tom T. Hall, and performed by Jeannie C. Riley, but has still been covered many times, including by Dolly Parton, and recently in an episode of Desperate Housewives! The story is roughly similar, although here our heroine is up against a small-town PTA (parents-teachers association). One video is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOZPBUu7Fro"">here</a>, lyrics <a href=""http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/hall-tom-t/harper-valley-pta-12424.html "">here</a>.<img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://www.thehumphries.org/harper_valley_pta/jeannie.jpg"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""250"" />But, we&#039;re still not done! Because according to the Wikipedia-entry above, it was also adapted into a Swedish version, called Frken Fredriksson (Ms. Fredriksson). I think this was originally performed by the Hootenanny Singers (a Swedish group), but later it was covered by the well-known ABBA. In this song, the story is quite different - the young unfortunate miss is seen watering plants in a nightie that is opened by the wind. Shocked by this sight, her busybody neighbor begins spreading rumors, and Fredriksson eventually has to leave town - right after calling out her neighbor as a hypocrite. The song can be heard <a href=""http://www.abbaunicef.cba.pl/froken_fredriksson%20-%20swedish.htm"">here</a>, and the lyrics are <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UueR_nL1E6U"">here</a>.It&#039;s a fun song to listen to, and it was a fun story to unravel. I love the ability of the Internet to bring together many different cases, and analyze them together. When the song came out, probably few in Norway had ever heard the ""original"", and if they wanted to listen to it, they would depend on it being offered for sale in Norwegian record stores. Now, it just takes a few minutes to find it.<img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://lh5.ggpht.com/_XzbYJQRS70o/R7NOtOOFgrI/AAAAAAAAAP0/KBEGKHFLnuk/10621.jpg"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""250"" />It&#039;s also interesting how the versions differ. I listened to a lecture at the University of Oslo once, by an anthropologist who also played in a punk rock band, he had spent time researching the punk culture in Korea. He made the point that by looking at what the songs protest against, you can learn something about the culture. In England and the US, the songs are often against the ""system"", the ""man"", the government, the police. In Korea, it was more often against ones own parents, and the schools.Thus, in the Norwegian version, the church is the oppressor, but in the US, it&#039;s a more generalized small-town oppressiveness. And the Swedish one (if it&#039;s really a remake, you can&#039;t always trust Wikipedia), it&#039;s common people&#039;s pettiness. However, that&#039;s also the saddest one, because in the other two, the protagonist gets the upper hand in the end, and ""shows them all"", whereas in the Swedish, she is still forced to leave town.<em>Update, I found a version from the film/tv series that was built on  the song:</em><object classid=""clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000"" width=""425"" height=""344"" codebase=""http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true"" /><param name=""allowScriptAccess"" value=""always"" /><param name=""src"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/4ivUOnnstpg&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1"" /><param name=""allowfullscreen"" value=""true"" /><embed type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""425"" height=""344"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/4ivUOnnstpg&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true""></embed></object>Listen and enjoy.Stian","dawn Pugh => It&#039;s amazing that it only took 15 mins to cut the first tape of Harper Valley PTA.  The only other change after that was the line they changed from  &ldquo;... the day that momma broke up the Harper Valley P.T.A.&rdquo; to &ldquo;...the day my momma socked it to, the Harper Valley P.T.A.&rdquo;  That was it. Jeannie C Riley had made it in the world of music and a world wide hit was born. . Multe Music => The original song in English is not just about small town morals. It was originally a country song. At the time the song was written and recorded, country music was strongly representative of life in the southern part of the USA, where morals were very influenced by conservative religious/church elements.   The Norwegian version of the lyrics are closer to the original English intent of the song -- but, as you say, different cultures interpret themes in their own way that speak to their culture.  The original English version, by the way, was an early and major cross-over hit from country to pop in the USA. The Swedish version was done as a solo recording by Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus, who was a member of Hootenanny Singers and, later, a member of ABBA. Another Norwegian version has also been recorded by Inger Lise Rypdal. .

WikiWars Conference Recap  => [...] 15, 2010 &middot; Leave a Comment  Stian Haklev has aggregated the tweets from WikiWars conference. From the post:  I am just back from Bangalore, [...]. "Equitable Governance in Multilingual Wikipedia,"events,languages,open access,p2pU,personal,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/01/19/equitable-governance-in-multilingual-wikipedia/,"I have been thinking about the issue of ""equitable access to governance in globally distributed multilingual organizations"" for several years now. That&#039;s a mouth-full, but basically the idea is that you have organizations like Wikipedia, the KDE project (an open-source desktop) or iCommons. Although these kind of organizations are often legally based in the US or another given country (KDE is in Germany), anyone are invited to contribute from around the world, and they often also have chapters based on language or nationality, where people can make huge contributions without speaking English (Wikipedia is the classic example).However, even though each Wikipedia version has a lot of freedom to set its own policies, it is still part of a much larger movement. The decisions on movement-wide changes, on what the Wikimedia Foundation should work on, etc, are mostly conducted in English. Whether it be on mailing lists, discussion pages, or international conferences. This excludes many people from participating, however solving it is a very thorny question. When I was invited to the<a href=""http://www.cis-india.org/news/wikiwars""> Critical Point of View:  WikiWars conference</a> in Bangalore recently (see <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/01/14/tweets-from-critical-point-of-view-wikiwars-conference-in-bangalore/"">my tweets</a>), I thought it would be a good chance for me to think more deeply and constructively about these issues, and see if I could come up with some suggestions.This is doubly relevant because of the <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">Peer2Peer University</a>, which is planning to expand to offer courses in more languages. How can we ensure that the course-organizers and students in those courses still feel like empowered parts of the community?With this presentation, I try to make two points. First of all, to make people cognizant that there <em>is</em> a problem. Secondly, to realize that there is no simple solution, but that we might be able to mitigate the problem, if we put our best minds to it.I have embedded below the presentation I gave (15 minutes), with synched audio.

Initially, each language was hosted on the same website, but soon, individual wikis were set up for each language. Thus, each language fostered its own community, with all communication happening in the given language on a localized Mediawiki platform. When visiting different Wikipedias, it is interesting to see the different community norms and standards that have emerged, for example different criteria for featured articles, notability, gaining admin status, etc.<span id=""more-444""></span>Thus we have communities around the world using Wikipedia in their own language, spending large amounts of time and energy contributing to articles, and also participating actively in governance and discussion in their community. However, the different Wikipedias are also impacted by decisions made at the central level, that cover all the different Wikipedias. To what extent is this discussion and governance process accessible to users who do not speak English well?<strong>Methods of communication for central coordination of Wikipedia (Wikimedia)</strong>Wikipedia is a part of the larger Wikimedia family of projects, which also includes projects like Wikiversity, Wiktionary, Commons, etc. Discussion for all of these projects, and across all languages, is supposed to happen on Meta. Meta is supposed to be multilingual, however as of 2004, 85% of the material posted there was in English. I don&rsquo;t have newer figures, but despite the fact that there are facilities for translating Wikipages on Meta-Wiki, and some projects and standards for promoting translation, anecdotal evidence suggests that translation is very spotty, if available at all.As an example, if I enter the front page of http://meta.wikimedia.org, I will see a list of &ldquo;Meta in many languages&rdquo;. Let us assume that I am a Japanese user - Japanese is the second most popular Wikipedia in terms of hits, with 1,3 million hits per hour (as of Nov 30, 2009), and English knowledge among Japanese is often limited. I would select to see Meta in Japanese, and I receive a very deceptively nice Japanese page with a number of links, to ongoing discussions about new projects, requests for adminship, links to mailing lists and IRC channels, news, etc. However, with very few exceptions, when I click on any of these links, the resulting page is in English. Thus if I as a Japanese user, who have made large an important contributions to both the content and the governance of the Japanese Wikipedia, decide that I want to participate in the central coordination, I have no venue except to learn English.As mentioned above, there are also IRC channels, and a large number of mailing lists, including foundation-l, which discusses the legal and organizational issues facing the Wikimedia foundation, and wikitech-l, which is the main forum for coordinating development of the Mediawiki platform that all Wikipedias run on. These international mailing lists are all in English. There are also local mailing lists for each language, and in a few cases, regional mailing lists covering adjacent languages (there was a Scandinavian mailing list, for example, but it seems defunct).<strong>Physical meetings</strong>Every year, the Wikimedia Foundation hosts an international conference called Wikimania. This is a place for all the different projects to come together and discuss their experiences, learn from each other, and also discuss issues facing Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects going forwards. The official presentations at these conferences are usually all held in English, although sometimes there are parallel tracks in one other language, reflecting the location the conference is hosted (for example, Spanish in Latin America, and Chinese in Taiwan).The informal communications happening outside of the planned tracks can of course be in any language, but for monolinguals, that is not of much help. An added challenge is that listening comprehension and ability to express ideas coherently orally is typically much more difficult to attain, than an ability to follow an argument in a written format. This means that even people with medium English-language skills can feel excluded from these discussions, may lack the self-confidence to speak up and contribute to a discussion, etc.<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Problem statement</span>Thus, let me summarize. Wikipedia is a community project that strives to be democratic and participatory, both in the day to day minor decisions and management, but also in the larger policy issues. It is also a thoroughly international community, with a large percentage of users who do not speak English, or do not speak English well. Currently those users are able to participate fully at the individual Wikipedia level, but for all global discussions around the project as a whole - whose impact may often be felt in the day-to-day operation of the individual Wikipedias as well - are almost entirely conducted in English.Wikipedia management and governance is a complicated issue, and there are certainly many who speak English perfectly, and still feel that participating is very difficult. It can be difficult to keep track of all the Talk pages and discussions going on at any point, many cannot afford to travel to Wikimania, or just prefer to spend their time contributing to the actual contents, rather than on long debates that might not lead to anything. Thus, this paper is not at all arguing that language skills present the only barrier to realizing full community participation. Much work should be done on discussing Wikipedia governance (and governance of large volunteer online projects) in general. However, language presents an additional obstacle that is almost insurmountable, even for the most savvy local administrator.<strong>Solutions</strong>It is not the intention of this paper to propose any finished solutions, because this is a thorny problem that can probably never be solved to a hundred percent satisfaction. Thus, the goals of this paper are two-fold. First of all, to raise awareness of this important issue, and second to begin a discussing, and propose some tentative ideas for ways to mitigate the issue.To discuss this topic in a systematic fashion, it would have been useful to have some kind of a map of the different Wikipedia decision/participation processes. We would need to separate between day-to-day decisions (many of these occur at the individual Wiki-level, but there are others that may occur at a more global level - for example, which new Wiki to approve, who should be given admin, etc) and participating in the larger policy debate about Wikipedia&rsquo;s direction (such as whether to shift to the Creative Commons license, whether to allow non-commercial pictures in Commons, whether to allow ads, etc).It would also be very helpful to understand more about the demographics of those active in the local Wikipedias. Some of the people active in non-English Wikipedias speak excellent English (for example many people editing the Hindi Wikipedia might be students and professors in the US, but even Norwegians living in Norway will typically have little problem speaking English). Another large group have some ability to read/write English, but might still have problems participating fully. A third group have extremely limited or no English skills at all.Below I will try to sketch out two categories of support that can be given to the two last categories, first for online communications, and then for conferences. This is very preliminary, and I am hoping for more feedback and ideas in this area.<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Online communications</span><strong>Crutches</strong>For people who do have some knowledge of English, but still have problems fully participating, we might be able to provide some &ldquo;crutches&rdquo; to help them participate more fully. This is exactly my position in Chinese -- I speak Chinese, and can read/write it, but read very slowly, and sometimes have problems formulating myself, etc. What would these crutches look like -- what are the issues people with limited English skills face?Reading comprehension is one, but the Internet has done a lot alleviate this, with all kinds of online dictionaries and reading aids, etc. However, another problem that I constantly run into, is that my reading speed in Chinese is so extremely much lower than my reading speed in English. In addition, I am not able to &ldquo;skim&rdquo; in Chinese. Only when you loose this ability, do you realize how much information you process habitually when scanning websites looking for interesting news, etc.Thus, things that might be helpful to enable this category to participate more actively online, would be providing summaries of discussions in different languages, translating headlines of debates, etc. If someone can quickly scan through a list in their own language to see if there are any issues that interest them, they can then spend the time it takes to work through the text in English on that topic, using the online tools to their disposal. But without such an &ldquo;indexing&rdquo; service, it can seem almost overwhelming to even begin reading through the page.<strong>People with low or no English abilities</strong>For these people, it&rsquo;s not a question of helping them to read English, it&rsquo;s offering an alternative -- ie. translation. However, how can this possibly be done by an organization that depends on voluntary labor, given the amount of languages to cover, and the amount of text that would need to be processed (much of which, it can seem, just consists of endless back-and-forths, that might be less than inspiring for even a motivated translator). There are a few possible ways of making this easier: we can reduce the amount of languages, reduce the amount of text, or make the translation work less demanding itself.<strong>Reducing number of languages</strong>Although there might be thousands of languages in the world, and several hundred represented on Wikipedia, many of these languages are closely related. To take my own language Norwegian, most Norwegians would be quite comfortable reading in Norwegian, Swedish or Danish, but would only themselves be able to write in Norwegian.If we could thus determine that these three languages never had to be translated into each other, then everybody could write in Norwegian, Swedish or Danish, and content in other languages would be translated into one of these three. That already lightens the load considerably. There would need to be a lot of discussion about which languages this were possible for, some obvious that come to mind are Lao and Thai, Malay and Indonesian, Serbian and Croatian, Finnish and Estonian.The North-Indian languages are written in different scripts, but using Google&rsquo;s great transliteration engine you can now transliterate Bengali into Hindi (the words will still be somewhat different, but it&rsquo;s possible that educated Indians would be comfortable with it). Perhaps Italian, Spanish and French (and Rumanian)? could be folded into one, etc. As I said, this is something that would have to be determined in consultation with all the language communities, although one would have to try to avoid too much politics interfering, people who refuse to understand their neighbours language for nationalistic reasons, etc.One could probably also exclude a number of languages of countries where people are known to generally speak very good English (although we have to be very careful with this to avoid including only the elites). This is not a perfect or fair system, but we are not the UN and cannot hire thousands of translators, this is an attempt at ameliorating the existing sub-par situation.<strong>Reducing amount of content</strong>Even if there were people that were willing to make a contribution in translating a certain amount of material - how to choose? How to determine what is important and what is not? This is related to the above point in crutches, and figuring this out, might make participation in governance easier for everyone. We could also be better at parsing out important discussion questions into the various linguistic communities for them to discuss within themselves, and then have a summary brought to the international stage (although this could also be criticized for not enabling direct access to the international discussion.<strong>Conferences</strong>Conferences are in many ways more difficult than online communications. However, there are certainly many possibilities for &ldquo;crutches&rdquo;, whether one gets the Powerpoints translated ahead of time, and lets people download them (it&rsquo;s much easier to follow along if you know what someone is talking about), or perhaps someone is typing summaries of what is being said on IRC in realtime. There is a lot of room for experimentation here. A final possibility would be to better integrate all the different local and regional conferences that are held, by trying to have the results or summaries published, and translated, having people blogging in different languages about what is going on, etc.<strong>Conclusion</strong>I hope I have convinced you that this is a really important question, and that although it is very thorny and does not have an easy solution, there are many ways in which we could improve on the existing condition. However, it&rsquo;s imperative that we do this in consultation with all those who need this facilitation, and don&rsquo;t &ldquo;assume&rdquo; what their needs might be. I look forward to meeting everyone at the conference, and hearing all of your ideas and feedback!",OER and P2PU: Talk at Indira Gandhi National Open University,"Education,events,India,open access,open-education,p2pU,personal,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/01/20/oer-and-p2pu-talk-at-indira-gandhi-national-open-university/,"I have been very interested in the work of <a href=""http://www.ignou.ac.in/"">Indira Gandhi National Open University</a> (IGNOU) for a long time.

"Key numbers from China&#8217;s 2010-2020 education plan,"china,Education,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/02/28/key-numbers-from-chinas-2010-2020-education-plan/,"In 2001, I spent a year teaching English in Wuhan University of Science and Technology. That certainly gave me a first flavor of Chinese university life, but I still understood very little about the Chinese higher education system - partly because that university was a private-public venture, which (at least my campus) seemed to focus more on training than education, let alone research. Also, my Chinese was not good enough at that time to really understand all that went on. In the last two years, I&#039;ve been researching a large Open Educational Resource project in Chinese higher education for my MA. During this time, I&#039;ve had a chance to visit many Chinese universities, interact with Chinese professors and MA students, give some lectures, read a number of academic articles, etc.I&#039;ve also had reason to learn more about the history and development of Chinese higher education, since this is very related to my research (which is in comparative education). Finally, because I am in general interested in higher education, and have been amazed at the rapid progress of the Chinese system, I&#039;ve tried to understand more about the national debate.Recently, I was made aware of a report called the ""National Outline for Medium and Long-term Education Reform and Development (2010-2020)"" (国家中长期教育改革和发展规划纲要), which will lay out the direction of Chinese education for the next ten years. This report has been more than a year in the making, with a large amount of public consultations, online consultations, and a series of expert roundtables, where both the Minister of Education, and the Prime Minister of China have participated.Most of my research, and interest, is around higher education, so I will focus on that. During the Cultural Revolution, higher education was essentially suspended, and it only reopened in 1977, with the relaunching of the national unified exam. This was also the beginning of the 30 years of opening, which is currently celebrated in China. In the 1990&#039;s, the government instituted large projects like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_985"">Project 985</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_211"">Project211</a> to increase the quality of education, and introduce communications technology into higher education. 1999 saw the beginning of an explosive growth in the system, which led to the 4 million enrolled students when I was teaching in 2001 becoming 27 million enrolled students in 2009.So what do the next ten years hold? So far, the news that has been most widely reported is the idea that universities will become more independent from the government. I might blog more after I&#039;ve read the report (it&#039;s quite long), but for now, I thought I&#039;d repost, and translate, their table over how key numbers will change from 2010 to 2020. The entire report can be found <a href=""http://www.moe.gov.cn/edoas/website18/zhuanti/2010zqyj/zqyjg.htm#_Toc254687644"">here</a> (in a horrible Word-converted HTML file, which uses 2.7 MB to present 80KB worth of text). I didn&#039;t find many English news articles about the report, but there are some mentions from domestic media (<a href=""http://www.bjreview.com.cn/headline/txt/2010-03/01/content_249096.htm"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.bjreview.com.cn/headline/txt/2010-03/01/content_249096.htm"">2</a>, <a href=""http://english.cri.cn/4406/2009/03/04/2041s460407.htm"">3</a>).<table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>2009</strong></td><td><strong>2015</strong></td><td><strong>2020</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pre-school</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>kids in kindergarten</td><td>26M</td><td>35M</td><td>40M</td></tr><tr><td>three year pre-school participation rate</td><td>50.9%</td><td>62%</td><td>75%</td></tr><tr><td>one year pre-school participation rate</td><td>74%</td><td>90%</td><td>95%</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>nine year obligatory schooling</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>students</td><td>157M</td><td>161M</td><td>165M</td></tr><tr><td>participation rate</td><td>90.8%</td><td>93%</td><td>95%</td></tr><tr><td>high school</td></tr><tr><td>students</td><td>46M</td><td>45M</td><td>47M</td></tr><tr><td>participation rate</td><td>79.2%</td><td>87%</td><td>90%</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>vocational education</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>secondary vocational education students</td><td>21M</td><td>22M</td><td>23M</td></tr><tr><td>higher vocational education students</td><td>13M</td><td>14M</td><td>15M</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>higher education</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>students</td><td>30M</td><td>33M</td><td>35M</td></tr><tr><td>students on campus</td><td>28M</td><td>31M</td><td>33M</td></tr><tr><td>of which: graduate students</td><td>1.4M</td><td>1.7M</td><td>2M</td></tr><tr><td>participation rate</td><td>24.2%</td><td>36%</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>continuing education</strong></td></tr><tr><td>employed persons in continuing education</td><td>166M</td><td>290M</td><td>350M</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>goals for developing human capital</strong></td></tr><tr><td>population having attained higher education</td><td>98M</td><td>145M</td><td>195M</td></tr><tr><td>average years of education for working population</td><td>9.5Y</td><td>10.5Y</td><td>11.2Y</td></tr><tr><td>of which: received higher education</td><td>9.9%</td><td>15%</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>average years of education for new work force</td><td>12.4Y</td><td>13.3Y</td><td>13.5Y</td></tr><tr><td>of which: received high school degree</td><td>67%</td><td>87%</td><td>90%</td></tr></tbody></table>A few things which I noticed. The participation rate of students goes up drastically (from 25% to 40%), but the number of students does not. This must mean that demographic predictions show a large decrease in cohort sizes. This is natural, given the lowering birthrates, but I didn&#039;t expect it to be so clear. That will have a huge impact on the Chinese labor market in the future. I am also curious about how the much higher level of general education among the labor force in 2020, including a doubling in the amount of working-age people with a university degree, will have on all aspects of Chinese society.This also explains why the expansion of Chinese higher education has now more or less stopped - I thought it was because they were not planning to raise participation rate strongly during the next few years, but in fact, with an increase in enrolment of just 16% over 10 years (nothing for a system that six-doubled enrolment in the previous ten years), China can reach a participation rate of 40%, which is very respectable internationally. This also means that all the new money coming into the system (another important number is that they want to raise investment in education to 4% of GDP - this of course a GDP that itself increases by 8-12% per year) will go to improve access (there is much talk about fairness and access in the plan) and quality.Also interesting that they are not planning to increase the number of distance education students (this is my inference from the gap between students and students on campus). This is congruent with what I have heard from friends, that China is trying to reorient it&#039;s substantial distance-education system from it&#039;s previous role as a stop-gap from a higher education system that did not have space for everyone who wanted to study, to a tool for implementing life-long learning. This is also seen from the very ambitious figures for life-long learning (350M employed persons participating in life-long learning by 2020!).The only kind of higher education which will increase rapidly in numbers is the number of graduate students, which will grow by 42% in real terms. Given the predicted smaller cohorts, this will mean a very large increase in the percentage of students with graduate degrees.Given that this is a report focused on education, and not research, it doesn&#039;t say anything about the growth in professors, researchers etc. There is another report focusing on the growth of science and technology from 2006 to 2020, which might talk more about this. These are the only numbers in the report (in a table format), the other parts seem to be much more oriented to ideals and directions, rather than measurable targets. But I will write more when I&#039;ve read the whole thing.Stian","GCCCE 2011 in Hangzhou | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] school districts.

"Peer2Peer University in the news,"Education,open-education,p2pU,personal,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/03/28/peer2peer-university-in-the-new/,"I should probably have written a lot more about Peer2Peer University, it&#039;s developing rapidly, facing tons of challenges, and turning out to be an amazing learning process about so many different aspects of social learning and the creation of online communities. But I end up writing my thoughts on the mailing lists, and working on improving the community, rather than blogging.However, I thought I&#039;d share a few newspaper articles resulting from interviews that I&#039;ve done. It&#039;s fun to have a chance to explain to journalists (or bloggers) about our vision, progress, and challenges. Sometimes you spend hours talking to a given journalist, helping them with links, etc, and you end up with a tiny notice -- but I guess that&#039;s part of the game, and anyway often the information I give them becomes part of a larger article about OER or open education initiatives, and I&#039;m happy for more people to learn about this whole field, not just the one initiative that I am involved with.One of the first one was the magazine <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L&#039;Actualite"">L&#039;Actualit</a>, one of the highest-circulation weeklies in Quebec. The result was a piece about P2PU and University of the People, as part of a much larger feature on the future of universities. You can <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/actualite.jpg"">download a scan</a>, or read the text below.<strong>Inventez votre propre universit</strong><em>Daniel Chrtien (L&#039;actualit, 15 November, 2009)</em>Pas de salles de cours, pas d&rsquo;quipe de football, pas de vaste campus gazonn et, souvent, pas de... professeurs! Bienvenue  la Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) et  la University 0f the People (UoPeople), deux tablissements entirement virtuels, gratuits et ouverts  tous.Depuis septembre, un peu plus de 300 tudiants, dans une cinquantaine de pays, suivent des cours universitaires par Internet. Mais  la diffrence des Tluq et autres programmes d&rsquo;tudes offerts sur le Web, ceux de la UoPeople et de la P2PU s&rsquo;appuient d&rsquo;abord sur la collaboration entre les tudiants plutt que sur l&rsquo;enseignement magistral prodigu par un professeur.Chaque tudiant doit donc mettre la main  la... souris. Sous la supervision d&rsquo;un enseignant bnvole, les tudiants montent les cours, prparent les recueils de notes et animent les discussions. Le tout en anglais. Nous assemblons notre matriel  partir de ce qui existe dj, dit Shai Reshef, fondateur et recteur de la University of the People. Nos tudiants utilisent les possibilits qu&rsquo;offrent les nouvelles technologies et toutes les ressources mises en ligne gratuitement par les universits traditionnelles.Il n&rsquo;est d&rsquo;ailleurs pas question de remplacer ces universits, mais d&rsquo;offrir aux tudiants une solution de rechange, prcise Stian Haklev, Norvgien d&rsquo;origine qui vit aujourd&rsquo;hui  Toronto et cofondateur de la Peer 2 Peer University. Objectif: rendre la formation universitaire accessible au plus grand nombre, et ce, dans le monde entier.Le nombre de programmes et de cours offerts est encore restreint. Ils vont des traditionnels programmes d&rsquo;administration des affaires et d&rsquo;informatique,  la UoPeople, aux cours &mdash; moins classiques &mdash; de neurothique, de droits d&rsquo;auteur pour enseignants, de littrature cyberpunk ainsi que de poker et pense crative,  la P2PU. Tous les cours sont gratuits. La University of the People exige toutefois des frais lis  l&rsquo;admission et  l&rsquo;administration des examens. Mme si aucune des deux universits ne dlivre de diplme officiel, les tudiants esprent que la formation suivie les aidera  trouver du travail. Les cours ne peuvent pas non plus tre crdits dans une autre universit. Mais les deux tablissements y travaillent, assurent leurs fondateurs.<hr />Then I had a chance to talk to a Brazilian scientific magazine called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileu"">Galileu</a>, which printed a four-page article about the reinvention of the university. I will paste the short paragraph mentioning P2PU below, but it&#039;s worth <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/galileu.pdf"">downloading the PDF</a>, to read the whole article and see their nice illustrations.<strong>A reinveno da universidade</strong><em>Rita Loiola (Galileu, February 2010)</em>Algumas pessoas acham que o caminho pode estar em coisas como a Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU, que em portugus significa algo como Universidade Ponto a Ponto, que teria o mesmo sentido que os programas de torrent, nos quais os usurios compartilham informaes entre si) e a University of the People, instituies totalmente virtuais e gratuitas, lanadas no fim do ano passado. Enquanto a P2PU une estudantes de deiversas partes do mundo para dividir conhecimento e aprender em poucos cursos, a University of the People tem um currculo mais parecido com o das faculdades tradicionais. Mas as duas se baseiam em encontros online de pessoas que querem aprender. E essa  a principal ideia por trs dos novos cursos superiores.<hr />Finally, I had a chance to talk to a journalist from the highest-circulation daily in Malaysia, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_(Malaysia)"">The Star</a>. The result was a long article talking about different education initiatives, including a mention of P2PU. The whole article is <a href=""http://thestar.com.my/education/story.asp?file=/2010/3/14/education/5830131&amp;sec=education"">available online</a>, but as usual, I will paste the small part about P2PU below.<strong>Tapping into technology</strong><em>Priya Kulasagaran and Tan Shiow Chin (The Star, March 14, 2010)</em>Meanwhile, Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) has opted to radically experiment with the entire model of tertiary education.As its name implies, the project makes full use of the peer-to-peer learning concept, giving users an online platform to fashion university-level courses from open learning resources.&ldquo;The course organisers are responsible for structuring the modules and leading discussions, but everyone in the class will pitch in with their own knowledge and help move the class along together,&rdquo; says P2PU co-founder Stain Haklev.&ldquo;Our main focus is the collaborative learning process; I believe that everybody has the capacity to teach something.&rdquo;<hr />I also did an interview with <a href=""http://chronicle.com/section/Home/5"">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, about my research on Chinese Open Educational Resources (not about P2PU). The <a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/Countries-Offer-Different/48775/"">whole article is online</a>, and the part mentioning my research is below.<strong>Around the World, Varied Approaches to Open Online Learning</strong><em>Simmi Aulja and Ben Terris (The Chronicle of Higher Education, October 11, 2009)</em><em> </em><em> </em><span style=""font-style: normal;"">In Asia, national governments are supporting open courseware at top universities so that instructors and students at other institutions can learn from their videos and other material.</span><span style=""font-style: normal;"">China&#039;s government gives grants to dozens of universities to help them improve their undergraduate teaching materials and then put them online.

It serves multiple purposes, providing me a way of reflecting on what is being said, as a back-channel with other conference attendees, and to share some of what is happening with the outside world. Although 140 characters is obviously very short, I have often appreciated the little snippets of information coming out of conferences that I could not attend - at a minimum, it might inspire you to go check out people&#039;s blogs, Slideshare presentations or video/audio recordings, etc.After having tweeted intensively for a few days, I thus have bunch of tweets with the same hashtag. A few times in the past, I&#039;ve made a blog post with all my tweets for a given conference. Again, I am not sure how useful that is to others - but it is very easy to do, and it provides a quick reference for myself in the future.There might be several ways of doing this, but for me, I start by doing a search for #hashtag from:houshuang, with 50 hits per page. I then copy each page (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C) to TextMate. Now, there are many lines that we do not want, the easiest is to apply a text filter, select Text...Filtering...Copy Matching Lines Into New Document, and use the search query #hashtag - each line containing the hashtag should be a tweet, and each tweet should contain this hashtag, since that is what we searched for. This way we get rid of all the ""Welcome to Twitter"", etc lines.I also whipped up two one-line Ruby programs, that perform simple tasks. The first one, strip, removes all leading and trailing white space (there is already a command that removes trailing white space only, it users Perl. I could have used Perl for this one as well, but I feel more comfortable in Ruby):<pre><code>File.read(ARGV[0]).each {|l| puts l.strip}</code></pre>And a quick program that reverses the order of the lines (so that we get the first tweets first, instead of last):<pre><code>puts File.read(ARGV[0]).split(""\n"").reverse.join(""\n"")</code></pre>I&#039;ve created a screencast to show how it all comes together (note, there are many other ways of accomplishing this task, but I wanted to show an example of how easy and powerful it is to use regexps, and write small snippets for TextMate). <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/Textmate-tweets.mov"">Watch screencast</a> (eleven minutes, QuickTime).

I learnt a whole lot, not the least about the translation of MIT courses into Chinese, and the production of Chinese ""OCW"" courses. I used this idea to apply to an MA in comparative education, wanting to look at what kind of cultural issues translating MIT courses to Chinese would entail. I ended up studying the courses produced by Chinese universities instead, which has been a very exciting journey. I&#039;ve given a few presentations on this (all <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/publications-and-presentations"">here</a>), and should really be finishing my MA right now, rather than participating in this course.Just before I started that intro to open ed, I attended <a href=""http://archive.icommons.org/resources/isummit-07-presentations-1"">iCommons in Dubrovnik</a>, where in addition to finally seeing and meeting people like Cory Doctorow, Lawrence Lessig, Joi Ito and many others, I attended an amazingly well facilitated education track. That&#039;s where I met Philipp, Neeru and Delia, and where we began to slowly lay the plans for what would become the Peer2Peer University. Fast forward three years, and <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">P2PU</a> was just mentioned in <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/education/edlife/18open-t.html"">the New York Times</a> this week, we have run two cycles of courses, the <a href=""http://p2pu.org/course/list"">latest</a> with 16 courses, including 3 in Portuguese, and had an amazing <a href=""http://archive.p2pu.org/Workshop"">community meetup in Berlin</a>, as well as met and partnered with lot&#039;s of great, inspiring people. And to figure out how we can do this kind of open teaching and learning online even better, I&#039;m starting my PhD this fall, at <a href=""http://www.oise.utoronto.ca"">OISE</a> and <a href=""http://www.kmdi.utoronto.ca/"">KMDI</a>.So this course is a great <a title=""Lake Geneva after the rain in the afternoon - 02/11/2009 -  Beauty unfolds!

One of our early thoughts with P2PU was to experiment &ndash; we acknowledged that we could continue going to conferences and present ideas and theories around open online learning for several years more, but we wanted to actually do it. Inspired by all the other great people in the open ed movement, who are doers as well as thinkers. And sure enough, we have learnt incredibly much, and discovered so many new problems and issues, as we&#039;ve moved along with our project.Is this kind of a learning experience really available to everyone, or only very highly educated people with self-confidence and metaskills in abundance (which I think will characterize most of the people participating in this class, as it did with Wiley&#039;s original class)? What, if anything, can we do to make it more accessible? What is the role of the teacher, and how much can we reduce the ""load"" on the teacher, to make these kind of courses scaleable as free courses (or will that never be achieved &ndash; will we always need government subsidy or tuition to maintain really high quality teaching and learning?) What kind of organizational models work best &ndash; for different kinds of learners, for different kinds of courses?<img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3116/2864643037_4faced8b9f_m.jpg"" alt="""" width=""240"" height=""186"" />In our <a href=""http://archive.p2pu.org/"">first cycle</a>, we offered a wiki and a WordPress multiuser installation. Even within this limited framework, courses organized very differently. Some used only the wiki, some let everyone start their own blog, some had everyone blog on the same group blog, some used the wiki for collaborative writing in small groups, and then had the groups post the finished result on the blog, to be critiqued by other groups in the comments. Some of these courses were more successful than others (but &ndash; other than retention rate &ndash; how do we measure success, if every student coming in has a different background and a different purpose with taking the course?).Then, stepping back from the microlevel focus on courses (although I am intensely interested in that, and I will certainly be following this course, not only to learn from the content, but also see what I can learn from the form and the organization of the interaction), what is the future of the university in society. (I will admit that I am biased, and mainly focused on post-K12 education, although certainly interested in what comes before). These two years at OISE, I&#039;ve been doing Higher Education, and we have done readings about the history of the university, the precursors in ancient India, the shuyuan&#039;s in China, the Muslim seats of learning to the different European models that developed &ndash; the French and the German &ndash; to the different sociological roles that universities, professors, students, graduates have played. I think that this is all crucial background information, if we want to assess the future of education.<img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2463/3921784963_6226769d88_m.jpg"" alt="""" width=""240"" height=""168"" />If we want to replace universities, we need to understand the role of universities in society &ndash; and there is not one answer to that question, but many. And we need to keep an international perspective, because the world is growing increasingly globalized. We need to keep in mind much of continental Europe, where higher education is still essentially free, there is much smaller difference between types of institutions, and it&#039;s much easier to gain entrance. India, which is chafing at a 5% enrollment rate, with a much higher population that would qualify for, and could benefit from higher education, or China, which exploded it&#039;s enrollment rates from 4 million to 30 million over 10 years, and went from 5% enrollment to 25%, with <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/02/28/key-numbers-from-chinas-2010-2020-education-plan/"">40% projected in 2020.</a>Anyway, I whole-heartedly look forward to this course, and am excited to be doing it. I&#039;ve also succeeded with something I&#039;ve always wanted &ndash; to create a hybrid course. I invited a number of other people at my institution, who are interested in these kinds of issues, to take the course with me, and for us to meet once a week to discuss the topics of the course live. We&#039;re a neat group, including one professor of online learning, one lecturer in computer science, and several students from different departments. Time will tell if we will all manage to keep up with the course load, or if some will fall off, but I&#039;m very excited &ndash; also to use this course as a bit of a lever, to induce people at my institution who don&#039;t usually talk together, to do that.Let the learning begin!Stian<em>Thanks to <a title=""Tiag Ribeiro"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/56891569@N00/4534277631/"" target=""_blank"">Tiag Ribeiro</a>, <a title=""U-g-g-B-o-y-(-Photograph-World-Sense-)"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/43102195@N08/4074329103/"" target=""_blank""><em>U-g-g-B-o-y-(-Photograph-World-Sense-)</em></a><em>,  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/museemccordmuseum/"">Muse  McCord Museum</a></em> and <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/"">Nationaal  Archief</a> for the photos.<a title=""U-g-g-B-o-y-(-Photograph-World-Sense-)"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/43102195@N08/4074329103/"" target=""_blank""></a></em>","Benjamin Stewart => &quot;If we want to replace universities, we need to understand the role of universities in society&quot;  I would say if universities are going to continue to exist, they will need to recognize that informal learning has an important role to play within the context of formal learning environments. . ""Open Scholars and Divergence/Convergence, Groups/Networks","Education,open-education,p2pU,personal,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/04/19/open-scholars-and-divergence-convergence/,"<strong>Preparing for a course</strong>My supervisor at OISE is co-teaching a course with two of his PhD students called ""<a href=""http://www.kmdi.utoronto.ca/"">KMD</a>: Knowledge Communities: Patterns and Practices"", and he very graciously invited me to give a talk about ""open education resources, P2PU, implications of new media for learning  communities, etc"". They would require a brief intro, a short ""position statement"", at least three resources for the students to read/view before class, and <em>""any ideas for any pedagogical plan for your Thursday session. Note: most of the invited speakers will probably just give a talk and lead a discussion - to fill approximately 90 minutes. BUT WE ARE OPEN MINDED!""</em>.So this is kind of scary. I am all for active learning, and this will be a seminar-size class with extremely intelligent and outspoken graduate students, from a number of different disciplines and backgrounds (it&#039;s a course open to students from many different faculties), all with laptops and phones in very wired room. However, it&#039;s a lot more easy, and ""safe"" to prepare a talk, and give it, and then open for questions. Which is what I usually do (also because I usually don&#039;t have a choice). It feels especially challenging because I won&#039;t know these students before I come in, they&#039;ll have been together for four weeks (eight sessions, it&#039;s a compressed schedule for summer courses) by the time I get there. It would feel quite differently if I was designing the whole course. So I haven&#039;t quite decided how I will structure it yet, but luckily I won&#039;t have to decide right now. I did have to give them the three readings though, which meant that I had to browse around a bit.(Another neat aspect of the course design, is that all students are required to pose one question to me, ahead of class. I will apparently receive these, grouped by topic, the day before I meet them. Fun idea. I&#039;m all for using online tools and prep work to make the limited time we have for physical encounters much more valuable.)I started with watching a <a href=""http://cider.athabascau.ca/"">CIDER</a> talk by <a href=""http://terrya.edublogs.org/about/"">Terry Anderson</a> about <a href=""http://cider.athabascau.ca/CIDERSessions/"">Three Generations of Distance Education Pedagogy</a>, which was a <strong>great</strong> introduction to the field. I really want to go back and read some of the foundational texts, and his talk gave a very useful and clear overview of the landscape, with a lot of references for people (like me) who would like to dig deeper, read the original texts, etc. I&#039;ll probably assign this as one of the resources for the students. I then ended up watching two <a href=""http://tedxnyed.com/"">TEDxNYED</a> talks, while looking at different resources. The first was by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTOLkm5hNNU&amp;feature=player_embedded"">Jeff Jarvis</a>, and the second by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BH-uLO6ovI&amp;feature=player_embedded"">George Siemens</a>. Jeff&#039;s talk was fun, he talked about how schools should work as incubators, help students do projects and create stuff, rather than ""stamp out"" identical copies. But George&#039;s talk was amazing &ndash; really a perfect TED talk, with great story telling, and some very lucid ideas and thoughts. Going through all this material (which also brought up many associations &ndash; it&#039;s not the first time I&#039;ve looked at <a href=""http://www.connectivism.ca/about.html"">connectivist ideas</a>) inspired two completely different lines of thought, and the only thing they have in common, is that I&#039;ll mention them in the same blog post (no thin-slicing here :)).<strong>Open scholars and closed ones</strong>What&#039;s interesting is that I am both a very active ""self-learner"", with my learning networks, Twitter, Google Reader, online (and offline) conferences etc. At the same time, I am a graduate student in what we like to think of as one of the world&#039;s best schools of education, <a href=""http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/oise/"">OISE</a>. I have access to world-class faculty, and fellow students with very impressive backgrounds and achievements. However, OISE, and indeed most schools in North America, do not offer ""teaching and learning in higher education"", which was what I wanted to study. So I was torn between the Higher Ed program in the <a href=""http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/tps/Home/index.html"">Theory and Policy Studies department</a>, which will teach you everything about higher ed, except for what happens in the classroom (literally), or the <a href=""http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/depts/ctl/"">Curriculum, Teaching and Learning department</a>, which deals with teaching and learning, but almost exclusively in K-12.I ended up in Higher Ed for my MA, in addition to the <a href=""http://cide.oise.utoronto.ca/"">comparative education program</a>, and learnt about the history of universities, sociological theories of comparing different school systems, etc. However, on the side, I was attending conferences on OER, following debates on online learning, and even helped start a <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">social learning experiment</a>. Through all this, I picked up a lot of ideas, thoughts and questions about online and open learning, although I always felt that I was missing the ""fundament"". Which is why I will start my PhD in CTL (mentioned above) in the fall. In the meantime though, my informal learning network has played an important role. And even at OISE, although I haven&#039;t formally been enrolled in this department, I have spent a lot of time going to seminars, meeting with professors, doing projects and in other ways being involved.That was setting the stage, now comes my realization. Scholars like George Siemens, Dave Cormier, Stephen Downes, Terry Anderson &ndash; I follow their work, and I know about and understand their ideas. I watch their presentations on Slideshare, read their blog posts, sometimes read their articles in OA journals. I not only know what they are doing &ndash; I know them a lot better than I know most of the professors in my university! There are people doing great research on learning online, threaded discussion systems, blogging among students &ndash; but if you don&#039;t take their course, you have no access. And apart from the course being access restricted, and potentially costing money (although the latter is not a big issue for graduate students, since we pay a flat fee for time enrolled, not for credits taken), the bigger question is: Why do I need to study with you for 12 weeks, and write a 30 page essay, to be allowed to hear your ideas?Stephen Downes and George Siemens offers a course on connectivism... But imagine if they told you that this was the only way you could find out about their ideas? And that it was closed &ndash; only people willing to sign up and go through the whole program, would get access? I can find no online recordings of presentations the professors in my institution have done, I can very few blog posts, or slides. There are academic papers, but these only tell part of the story. What I want to know is your big ideas, your thoughts about online education. But for a scholarly journal, unless it&#039;s a conceptual idea piece, you have to only present your specific empirical research. So you might have written a detailed paper about investigating student blogging amount a sample <em>n</em> during time <em>t</em> after intervention <em>x</em>... but you did that study for a reason! And I&#039;d like to understand. The kind of reason that you can explain in a blog post, and not in an academic journal.So how is it that I have better ""access"" to scholars from far flung parts of the globe (like <a href=""http://www2.uiah.fi/~tleinone/"">Teemu</a> from Finland, or <a href=""http://leighblackall.blogspot.com/"">Leigh</a> from Australia), than to the professors that work in my own school of education? Just like I felt closer connected to the students in David Wiley&#039;s <a href=""http://www.opencontent.org/wiki/index.php?title=Intro_Open_Ed_Syllabus"">Intro to open ed</a>, than I felt with the 200 students sitting next to me in my undergraduate classrooms at <a href=""http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/"">UTSC</a>? Now, don&#039;t get me wrong &ndash; the professors at OISE are wonderfully supportive, and I have had great conversations with me, and they have given me of their time in ways that it would be very hard to demand from someone from another institution. But I want to hear your big ideas. I want you to be <strong><a href=""http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Scholar"">open scholars</a>. </strong><strong>Convergence and divergence, groups and networks, common and decentralized</strong>This is a point that I will need to think about more, write about more, read about more. But I&#039;ll give it a start here. In 2008, as I started my studies at OISE, I was lucky enough to do a small seminar class with <a href=""http://www.ikit.org/people/scardamalia.html"">Marlene Scardamalia</a>. Marlene is a legend, she and her husband <a href=""http://www.ikit.org/people/bereiter.html"">Carl Bereiter</a> together came up with the concept of Knowledge Building (KB), and founded <a href=""http://www.ikit.org/"">Institute for Knowledge Innovation and Technology</a> to promote it. Together with others, they developed <a href=""http://www.knowledgeforum.com/"">Knowledge Forum</a>, a software to facilitate KB learning &ndash; <a href=""http://ikit.org/fulltext/2003_bringing.htm"">this</a> is a good introduction to their ideas, and there are many more papers <a href=""http://ikit.org/ikit_ref/resources.php"">here</a>. It&#039;s difficult to explain their ideas in a few sentences, but it&#039;s very much built on constructivism and inquiry.Think of kids in a classroom acting as junior scientists, they want to know why leafs change color. They come up with some ideas, then use the scaffolding built into Knowledge Forum to probe deeper &ndash; ""my theory is"", ""I need to know""... metacognitive prompts that aim to push the thought process further, rather than what usually happens in a threaded discussion board &ndash; everyone get&#039;s to say their opinion, and then the thread ""dies out"". In addition, the spatial organization of the KF database enables people to organize and reorganize the knowledge that the group has reached, so that the database is not just a chronological record of conversation, but represents the state of knowledge of the group at that time, and points the way forward to deeper thinking.This model &ndash; and there is really much more to it than what I just mentioned, it&#039;s very much worth exploring further &ndash; is inherently a group process. The concept of shared cognition &ndash; ""what the group knows"". It has advantages and disadvantages. I think the model of organizing and reorganizing knowledge, knowing the ""landscape of knowledge"", and using the metacognitive prompts to keep probing deeper is very powerful. It reminds me of something that always struck me as powerful from <a href=""http://iet-public-wiki.open.ac.uk/index.php/OPLRN_proposal"">the first Open Learn proposal</a> (then called OPLRN net) where <a href=""http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml"">CMU</a> and <a href=""http://www.open.ac.uk/"">OU</a> proposed to create a network for connecting research on open learning.<blockquote><em><strong>A research portal.</strong> In more established fields such as cancer  research, there is a consensus map of the structure of the field, the  major research questions, and the different sub-communities and  associated methodologies. It is possible to place oneself on the map,  and to coordinate effort in a well understood way. In contrast OER  research is a relatively young field, which has not yet being fully  articulated and defined. The OLnet will help to facilitate researchers  in the area to articulate the scope of the field and typical  methodological stances. At various points the OLnet will trigger a  series of questions and provide mechanisms to enable those in the field  to progress answers to those questions. What is the OER research map?  What is the OER design process? What does it mean to validate an OER?  What are the central challenges that all agree on? The OPLRN seeks to  create a structured &#039;place&#039; where questions such as these can be  debated, and hopefully, enabling more effective coordination of action  around issues and OERs of common interest.</em></blockquote>I really found this metaphor compelling. And in a way, it is simply taking the KB model, and applying it to a much broader field. However, the KB model, at least as I experienced it, has many shortcomings. What if your individual interest doesn&#039;t align with the group? In our course, I was one of the only ones to be interested in how KB could integrate with blogging, thus I could make my nodes and write all I wanted, but I didn&#039;t get much participation from the community. And given that the database is limited to a specific group (both because of the pedagogy, and because of technical limitations with the software), I&#039;m not able to easily pull in people from the outside who might be interested (and they won&#039;t be able to ""find"" me). It&#039;s the epitome of a walled garden, which might work fairly well for a small group of people over a limited amount of time (even then it has huge limitations), but not for a larger knowledge community over longer time. (Which might be why there isn&#039;t as far as I know, a vibrant discussion about knowledge building going on right now, between practitioners and researchers, inside a Knowledge Forum database... Or if there is, I don&#039;t know about it, can&#039;t find it, and am not invited.)Now, at the same time as I was taking this course, using Knowledge Forum for our discussions (and it worked remarkably well for that context!), I was following along on <a href=""http://www.downes.ca/"">Stephen Downes</a> and <a href=""http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/"">George Siemens</a>&#039; initial <a href=""http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/wiki/Connectivism_2008"">massive online open course</a> on Connectivism. They don&#039;t believe in groups, but promote networks. Networks work very differently, they are fluid, with weak and strong links, and don&#039;t have a defined beginning or end. Actors have different motivations &ndash; selfishness (in a good way, they are curious about something, and want to discuss it with people they can learn from), but also altruism, and a desire to boost their ""community cred"" (which can lead people to do good things, but which can also result in perverse incentives). We use a number of tools to connect with each other, both semantic (let me see all the people tagging their posts a certain way) and personal (I want to subscribe to Siemens&#039; writings).Lot&#039;s of benefits here. It&#039;s all out in the open (it has to be, otherwise nobody will connect with you). There is a huge amount of diversity in the network, which leads to much more creativity and new ideas being introduced. There is a complete freedom to explore different paths and ideas. Yet, I am sometimes nostalgic for some of the features of groups and knowledge building. We seem to loose that map of the landscape that is mentioned in the quote above, and we don&#039;t seem to have any desire to create one. It will be interesting to what extent we as a community can move to a deeper understanding on a number of issues during the current <a href=""http://edfutures.com/"">EdFutures course</a>.In discussing threaded conversations, Scardamalia and Bereiter writes<blockquote>The distinctive characteristics of Knowledge Forum are perhaps most easily grasped by comparing it to the familiar technology of threaded discussion, which is to be found everywhere on the Worldwide Web and also as a part of instructional management systems like Blackboard and WebCT. Threaded discussion is a one-to-many form of e- mail. Instead of sending a message privately to people the sender selects, the sender &ldquo;posts&rdquo; it to a discussion site, where all posted messages appear in chronological order, with one exception: a response to a message is shown indented under the original message, rather than in chronological order. Responses to that response are further indented, and so on, forming a &ldquo;thread&rdquo; that started with the very first posting. Like e- mail messages generally, a discussion forum message, once &ldquo;posted,&rdquo; cannot be modified.&ldquo;Threading&rdquo; produces a downward-branching tree structure, which is the only structuring of information (besides chronological) that the technology allows. There is no way to create higher-level organizations of information, to comment simultaneously on a number of messages, or to make a connection between a message in one thread and a message in another. Thus the possibilities for knowledge building discourse are extremely limited. In fact, our experience is that threaded discussion militates against deepening inquiry; instead, it is much more suited to rapid question-answer and assertion- response exchanges. Although communities based on shared interests do develop in some threaded discussion forums, this technology provides little means for a group to organize its efforts around a common goal. As the number of postings increases, what appears on the screen becomes an increasingly incoherent stream of messages, leading discussion monitors to impose arbitrary limits on thread length and to erase threads of a certain age. Thus a cumulative advance in the state of knowledge is hardly conceivable. (<a href=""http://www.ikit.org/fulltext/2006_KBTheory.pdf"">Knowledge Building: Theory, Pedagogy and Technology - rtf</a>)</blockquote>This is about threaded discussions, but what about when everyone is posting on their own blog, using aggregators to ""suck it all in"", so we can ""drink from the firehose""? I have no doubt that deep thinking is happening; much of my thinking is informed by what I have read and thought about, throughout the last three years, and I constantly see that the ""great thinkers"" are improving upon their thinking, playing off each other. But how efficient is this process with 10-20 learners, in intense engagement? Or 200, as for the EdFutures course? To what extent will we be able to, as a group/community/network keep pushing for a higher level of understanding? Or is that even realistic, or desirable, given that everyone enters the course with different expectations and wishes?In some ways, this dance between convergence and divergence reminds me of some of the workshops I attended with <a href=""http://www.careindonesia.or.id/"">CARE Indonesia</a> when I worked there. We&#039;d have great facilitators who got us to write down all our ideas on yellow notes, that we put up on the board. Then we&#039;d group them into categories, and give names to the categories, and collapse all the individual notes into the categories. Then we&#039;d use the titles we&#039;d come up with, and start generating new ideas around them. Which would be grouped again, etc. It&#039;s a powerful method, but done without enough leadership, you feel like you are caught in an eternal dance between narrowing down and broadening out.I&#039;m going to keep thinking about these things, and I&#039;d love to hear people&#039;s ideas (if anybody got to the end of this piece).Stian","Presentation: Viewing Open Education from the Perspectives of Knowledge Building and Connectivism | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] wrote earlier about preparing to give a guest lecture in a class called KMD 1002: Knowledge Communities: Patterns [...].

I enjoyed your call for open scholarship. I understand that the pay off for hiding knowledge no longer applies? But it&#039;s still a transition time and there will be much that I cannot know as I&#039;m not an academic.I think that this type of delivery that edfutures affords encourages the same serendipitous connections that surfing the web and neurons themselves make. It&#039;s like my mind is searching for solutions for making the connections solving the puzzle and the next piece appears. But then I can be guilty of seeing what I want to in any given resource. Still I like the discovery aspect it is it&#039;s own reward and I feel grateful to find you!. houshuang => Hi Najmeh, thanks a lot for the comment. Yes, I think we are seeing a lot of interesting tools that try to make it easier to bring together information, however so far most of the tools I have seen have been trying to &quot;choose the wheat from the chaff&quot; so people don&#39;t drown in from the fire hose, which is valuable in itself. But I haven&#39;t seen that many tools or platforms that let/or encourage you to really work with the information to build something new, and deeper (or higher order)...  Jim Hewitt has the idea of combining a wiki with a discussion forum, to combine the &quot;stream of conversation&quot; with the &quot;integrative&quot; aspect of a collaboratively edited wiki. I would still love to hear more about the difference between a wiki and knowledge forum, but I wonder if that could be one way - if people could somehow be induced to update a wiki, as they post on their blogs around the world... But how to induce/facilitate that? And I suppose it would become less useful, the less agreed the group was about what their common object of learning/inquiry were?  In some ways though, it&#39;s like a survey article. And I&#39;ve often wished there were really good survey articles maintained more like a wiki, and less like something that is published and then becomes obsolete. There are lot&#39;s of fields I&#39;d like to move into, where I feel immediately lost, not &quot;knowing the landscape&quot;... (This goes for countries and languages too - I&#39;d love to know what the &quot;state of the art&quot; in Chinese research on OER is, but I have no idea where to start). Stian . Najmeh => ha! it&#039;s funny because I was thinking along the same lines last night - well, I&#039;ll tell you how differently . I know KB well enough, but I&#039;m only beginning to know George Siemens, David Cormier, etc.  When I was learning about Knowledge Building, I didn&#039;t think of it along convergence &amp; divergence, but rather graphs and nodes and trees (I LOVED linear algebra ;) ... and how, the problem is that some nodes remain childless ... and how might that be rectified? (back then, I didn&#039;t know too much about &quot;open&quot; anything, I thought the solution would be a longitudinal one - connecting  ideas not across space, but across time.)  Now, as I am looking through connectivism and looking at their mapping of networks ... it seems to me (at this uneducated point) that this will only work if each cluster in the network is a well connected graph. - the algebraic connectivity of a graph being the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian, and a measure of how well connected the graph is.  It&#039;s kind of like the problem reversed in a way.   And I wonder if there could be computational models that could reshape the network, I&#039;m sure that a lot of times, the clusters can be reordered to look different, and maybe even better connected.   But you&#039;re right, within individual clusters, something like a more robust KF might work wonders ...  rambling again ... sorry :-P . "Read community blogs on P2PU Planet!,"open-education,p2pU,personal,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/04/28/read-community-blogs-on-p2pu-planet/,"As we are building the P2PU community, we are constantly thinking about how to organize communications, how transparent we should be, how we can make the community welcoming and attract more volunteers, etc. Initially it started as mostly communications between the five founders, then after Berlin, we felt like a really strong bigger community, and we began to push most of the conversation onto the ""gang"" list, which has now grown to about 35 members, who have all been very active in the community.But we want to keep growing, and be welcoming to people coming in from the outside. One of the things I often think about is what I would do and think, if I had just discovered P2PU now, rather than being part of it from the beginning. How would I seek information, be inspired to join, what opportunities would I have? When I&#039;ve been interested in getting involved with communities in the past, I&#039;ve often visited their ""planets"" - sites that aggregate blogs from the community. So I used to read <a href=""http://www.planetkde.org/"">Planet KDE</a> regularly, following the different developers thoughts and ideas.As P2PU develops, we struggle with a huge amount of issues &ndash; we constantly want to improve our platform, the way courses run, people&#039;s level of engagement &ndash; but we are also stepping into virgin soil, and have to experiment as we go along. We have wonderful long conversations between community members when we meet, or on Skype, and there are long e-mail discussions on the gang list about every aspect of online learning. This has been the most incredible learning experience for me.And it has struck me that we should be more open, share more of our ideas, questions and conundrums &ndash; because we are not the only ones thinking about these issues, and to really move forward, we need the ideas and help from everyone in the community. We need to open up more, and involve more people in our conversations.P2PU already has an <a href=""http://blogs.p2pu.org"">""official"" blog</a>, for announcements and things we want to share with the community. Yet, I often felt a bit hesitant to post things there, thinking I needed to ""think it out more thoroughly"", that it wasn&#039;t very suitable for such a public platform, etc. (Sometimes my braindumps can be quite long and dense). So the idea of a Planet that would aggregate together the different personal blogs (usually just the category relevant to P2PU) seemed like a great idea. This way, I feel more incentive to write about P2PU, since it will get exposed to a larger audience, but still have a lot of freedom to experiment with how I tell it, since it&#039;s ""my blog"". It&#039;s also great to see what all the other members of the community are thinking.In addition to exposing more of the community through blogs, we are also working on the community functions of the <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">platform itself</a>. The <a href=""http://p2pu.org/p2pu-lounge-mar-2010"">P2PU Lounge</a> has emerged as the de-facto hang out place for new and old community members, and it has the advantage over the mailing list that anyone can view the post, and anyone who is logged in can contribute (you have to request entry for now, because it works like a course, but it&#039;s automatically granted to all). So hopefully that&#039;s what I would have done if I came to P2PU now &ndash; I would have looked around the site, read the official blog and the Planet to get the ""pulse"" of the community, and then joined the Lounge and thrown myself into discussions.We should also come up with some kind of a task list, or ""junior dev jobs"" which some open source projects have, because there are many who want to help out and don&#039;t quite know where to start.Lot&#039;s to do, lot&#039;s of exciting ideas, but I invite you all to follow along, comment liberally and share of your wisdom and experience, or join us in this crazy journey!Stian",Personal time tracker with Ruby and Growl,"personal,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/04/29/personal-time-tracker-with-ruby-and-growl/,"<strong>Introduction</strong>I&#039;m fascinated by the idea of measurement itself having an effect on behavior. For example, it has been show that simply letting people see how much electricity they are using at any given time, leads people to decrease their usage. Data is also necessary to experiment, and measure the effect. I was fascinated by the <a href=""http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/"">Hacker&#039;s Diet</a>, where one of the features is measuring your weight every day, but using a moving average to smooth out the data noise caused by varying levels of water, etc. (There are a number of web apps and iPhone, etc apps available for doing this as well).Yesterday, I came across a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/magazine/02self-measurement-t.html?pagewanted=all"">New York Times article</a> about the ""data driven life"". They showed how the wide availability of cheap measuring instruments (the primary being the cell phone, but also GPS chips, Wifi-enabled weights etc), and programs for crunching and visualizing data, some people are tracking a range of personal statistics, such as time use, weight, mood, sleep etc. This can be used for self-experimentation, one person did several experiments to find that his cognitive capacity went up with a spoon of flaxseed in the morning.These experiments are different from traditional scientific experiences in that they don&#039;t necessarily seek universality, rather than assuming that what happens to you can be applied to others, you are simply interested in what happens to you. Perhaps the person above is the only one reacting like this to flaxseed oil, but that&#039;s OK &ndash; he is the one who is going to be eating him &ndash; to him it&#039;s a profoundly useful discovery.Another difference is that instead of having very targeted and well-designed experiments, these individuals often just track data over long periods of time, for curiosity, or to see if any patterns emerge. Or perhaps to try to improve on some aspect of their life, such as weight loss, or wasting less time, and using the visualization of ""brutally honest"" data to drive that behavior change.<strong>How can I stay more focused online?</strong>I work on a number of different projects concurrently, they all (mostly) happen in front of the computer, and combined with all the distractions and interruptions (an e-mail just arrived, my friend paged me, let me check this thing), it can often be very difficult to get a sense of where time went. Sometimes in the evening, I think &ndash; wow, that was another day, but what did I actually achieve? And especially this summer, as I really need to finish my thesis, it becomes important to focus more on the important tasks, and cut down on the distractions.I came across the <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4476"">LeechBlock plugin</a> for Firefox, which is designed exactly for people like me, who get easily distracted. You can add a number of sites, specify whether they should be blocked for a certain time period, or after you have used them for a certain period of time each hour/day/week. Given that you are installing it, it&#039;s impossible to make the computer completely ""you-proof"", so the purpose is rather designed to make you slow down when you go to Reddit or Facebook, think twice, and go back to your real work. (That said, some of the options are designed to make it almost impossible to modify/uninstall the plugin while it&#039;s actively blocking).So I thought I&#039;d give it a try, I installed it, and listed a number of web pages I frequently visit, but which I don&#039;t really <em>need </em>to visit... Reddit, Google Reader, various newspapers, Daring Fireball, Boing Boing, etc. I wanted to be strict with myself, to get work done on my thesis, so I set it to block all access until 6PM every day. I also moved Chrome and Safari out of the Applications folder.The plugin does exactly what it says it&#039;s supposed to do. However, after a day I disabled it, for two reasons. The first is that although the sites mentioned above do take up a lot of my time, they are far from the only ones. In fact, that day I spent most of my time working on the <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">P2PU</a>, adding a <a href=""http://blogs.p2pu.org/planet"">Planet</a> for example. While this is useful work, it&#039;s not related to my thesis, and strictly, it could have waited. Yet there would have been no way of blocking every web page related to P2PU. And of course, the biggest time sink is perhaps my e-mail, but it&#039;s also vital to much of the research I am doing, so I could not block GMail. The second reason was that it felt very tiresome and annoying when I did need some of those sites for legitimate purposes &ndash; connect with a researcher on Facebook, or view a film clip related to my research on Youtube, and was blocked (with no option of turning it off).<strong>Getting a better sense of how I spend my time</strong>So inspired by the NYTimes article, I thought it would be fun to try to track my time online, and maybe through this, be able to focus more on the tasks that really matter. I put out <a href=""http://twitter.com/houshuang/status/13021680071"">a question</a> to my Twitter network: ""Interesting article abt data  tracking&amp;self-experimentation. Any good inobtrusive time trackers  for Mac? Sync with iPhone? nyti.ms/b4Eiro"". I got a number of answers (thanks all!), and I spent some time checking some of these tools out. However, none really did what I wanted. Many of them were designed more for freelancers and others needing to track their time for billing purposes, and some were integrated with impressive project managers.The key feature to me was the ease of entry. The whole purpose of this exercise would be to micro-measure how much time I spend on different tasks on my computer, which is often spliced in very small segments &ndash; two minutes reading e-mail, a minute chatting with a friend, five minutes writing a proposal, back to chat, back to the proposal... To be able to track something like that, I&#039;d need a way that was incredibly unobtrusive, and easy to manage. In fact, I instinctively had a fairly good idea of what I wanted: some little tool that sat in the menu bar, which enabled me to change the category it was tracing with a mode-less global shortcut. So I could quickly do Ctrl+Cmd 1, for category one, check my e-mail, then Ctrl+Cmd 2, back to report writing etc.However, none of the time tracking tools I found offered this functionality. They all had nice little boxes with a button to click on your mouse. But if I had to tab to find this application, and manually click on the category, it would never become something I integrated into my workflow. (Note that there are a <em>lot</em> of time trackers out there, it&#039;s quite possible that this exists, and I didn&#039;t find it.)<strong>Making my own</strong>So I could not found a tool that would do exactly what I wanted. Then I started wondering whether it would be possible to build my own tool. I realize the irony in spending this much time, trying to save time. But it&#039;s fun! My tool of choice is Ruby, and I realized that the actual tracking would be very simple &ndash; all that would be needed, would be to write a time-stamp with a category to a file. Later, a script would be able to go through that file and by looking at the various time-stamps, figure out how much time I had used.If for example I had stamped ""Sunday 3:01 PM - P2PU"" and later ""Sunday 3:15 PM - thesis"", then the script would output ""On Sunday 3:01 PM, you spent 14 minutes working on P2PU"".However this tiny script &ndash; a line or two &ndash; would have to be launched from a global shortcut. There are two ways of doing this. One is creating a service that launches the script using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_%28software%29"">Automator</a>. This service can then be assigned a global shortcut in the control panel (under keyboard). I tried this, and it worked, but it seems that you cannot edit the services from Automator, once you have created them. You can edit them manually, but the little text to execute is hidden into a huge XML file (sometimes Apple config files are incredibly verbose). In addition, you will have to create one service for every category you want to be able to trigger.Another possibility is <a href=""http://www.batista.org/freehotkeys.html"">FreeHotKeys</a> by Richardo Batista. It&#039;s a free download (unfortunately the disk image is SIT compressed, so you need to download the free Stuffit Expander as well &ndash; Mac nostalgia), and a small hidden program, that let&#039;s you assign random scripts to global hotkeys in a way that is much more easy to manage. I currently use this program, but the method above should work as well, and doesn&#039;t require any external programs.<strong>Visual feedback</strong><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tracker-newentry.png""><img class=""size-full wp-image-499 alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" title=""tracker-newentry"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tracker-newentry.png"" alt="""" width=""298"" height=""60"" /></a>As I said, the actual code for making a new time stamp is about one line long. I simply add a time stamp (output of Time.now.to_i) and the category as a new line to a text file. However, I would really appreciate some visual feedback to know that this has been achieved, and maybe telling me how much time I spent on the previous activity. There are a few ways of creating programs with a GUI on OSX, like MacRuby, RubyCocoa, etc. However, when I began reading up on NSObjects and interface builder, and nib files, my eyes glazed over. It&#039;s great that it&#039;s possible, but learning about it would require more time than I could justify for a project designed to save time...Then I remembered <a href=""http://growl.info/"">Growl</a>. It&#039;s a small library used by many different programs for providing unobtrusive visual reminders or notices on OSX. I looked around to see if there was a way that I could trigger Growl notices using Ruby. There is a Ruby library, but it seemed much easier to use <a href=""http://growl.info/documentation/growlnotify.php"">growlnotify</a>, a command line tool for creating notices. This way, the script could write the time stamp, and then send out a notice to let me know what was going on.Great! Except I ran into some snags. No matter what I did, the script worked great from the command line, but when launched through the global shortcut, growl wouldn&#039;t trigger (the time stamp was still written to file). I found two remedies (<a href=""http://craigjolicoeur.com/blog/problem-with-growlnotify-on-os-x-leopard"">1</a>, <a href=""http://hasseg.org/blog/post/111/growlnotify-leopard-incompatibility-workaround/"">2</a>), and I ended up with <a href=""http://hasseg.org/blog/post/111/growlnotify-leopard-incompatibility-workaround/"">this</a>, which worked perfectly (really hope the Growl team can fix this permanently!).<strong>Status</strong><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tracker-status.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-498"" style=""margin: 5px;"" title=""tracker-status"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tracker-status.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""332"" /></a>In addition to generating a file of timestamps, that could then be analyzed in any which way &ndash; graphs of time use over time, scatter plots, when during the day are you most likely to get distracted, etc. &ndash; I also wanted a quick status of the current day. To achieve this, I switched to recording the time stamps in a new file every day, so that I could quickly sort through this file and calculate cumulative totals. (I realize this might get me into trouble for tasks that continue past midnight, an unfortunately all to common issue. I have to put in a fix for this.)So I added a status script, which prints the current activity and how long you spent already, the cumulative totals for all activities today, and a ""cheat sheet"" for the different hot keys, and the categories which they trigger.Having done all this, I was very content, and finally went to bed. The whole thing took longer than I had thought, because I spent some time trouble-shooting Growl, etc. But in the end, I was very happy with what I had come up with. The whole project was about 110 lines of code (including white space and comments), but worked perfectly, and even looked good.<strong>Cleaning up the code</strong>This morning, I sat down to clean up the code a bit. This is how I usually develop &ndash; it starts out as a simple idea, you write a few lines, try them out. Then it grows, and becomes a mess of code with no functions, lot&#039;s of code duplication, paths and values hard-coded, etc. But it makes for rapid prototyping. Then, when I&#039;ve reached some basic level of functionality, I can look through the code again, begin picking out duplicated code and make it into functions, make parts of the script more robust and less dependent on me running it in exactly that directory, etc. I also added some comments. This makes the code incredibly much cleaner and neater to look at (and usually I end up removing a bunch of lines), and in addition to making it easier for others to get up to speed, it helps me a lot too, when I come back to it in a year or so.I put <a href=""http://github.com/houshuang/Personal-time-tracker"">all the code</a> up on Github. Note that I totally didn&#039;t write this for anyone else, it was purely to scratch a personal itch. Due to the way Ruby works, I am never contemplating to create some kind of an installer, etc. But if you are a bit technical, and want to have a look&ndash; be my guest! Anyone can fork the code and improve upon it. Right now, the categories are all hard-coded into <em>library.rb</em>, and are easy to change. (The way I use this, is that <em>0</em> means ""stepping away from the computer"", <em>1-5 </em>are different projects I&#039;m working on right now. <em>6</em> is ""goofing off"", ie. any time spent on the computer not doing one of these projects, and <em>7-8</em> are to free slots for shorter-term projects. For example, I am tracking how much I&#039;m spending on this tracker program right now in ""project 1"".<script src=""http://gist.github.com/383959.js?file=categories""></script>This was fun. Now I am going to actually use this program, and measure how effective I am. I don&#039;t know yet if I&#039;ll end up using this regularly or not, or what effect it will have, but it&#039;s an interesting experiment, and writing it was a fun exercise in how much you can do with little, when things are loosely coupled.(I haven&#039;t written a script that analyzes the time stamp files yet. There are lot&#039;s of ways to do it, it could output different kinds of data, even automatically upload it to a web service, etc. Feel free to play with it, and if I add such a script later, I&#039;ll make it available in GitHub.)Stian - off to be productive","houshuang => Thanks for your comment. I must admit I never actually ended up using it much. I also never wrote the interface for calculating statistics across days/weeks etc. Because it uses Growl (whose command line interface seems to differ slightly between versions), and a hotkey setup, it\&#039;s also difficult for me to provide some kind of install package (this is something Ruby is really weak on in general)... so it remains kind of a hobby project for others who know Ruby and want to tinker.  I am surprised nobody else have made kind of a polished program with the same design - it seems obviously useful. Maybe someone will feel inspired - the idea is there for the taking. . hikari => That was *way* cool :-)  Several months ago I used an application named ""Eternity"" in iPhone to track *everything* in my day, from wake up to wake up again. I was able to track down almost every day for a little over two months, I recall, and got to know that in average the time I spent to sleep is the same as time I spent on studying/research ;-)  But I got tired after that and quit. Unfortunately.  I wonder how&#039;s your experiment went? Did you post the ""result"" here? And I&#039;m also interested in your program, but I don&#039;t know how to make it work... if only you could provide some easy steps..  Thanks for a good article! .

"P2PU and homeschoolers?,"Education,open-education,p2pU,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/05/01/p2pu-and-homeschoolers/,"One of the fun things about <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">P2PU</a> is that we really didn&#039;t design it for one particular narrow demographic &ndash; it could be useful to anyone, whether it&#039;s high school students who want more challenging classes (and in the future, maybe earn some AP credits and skip a year of university), retired people who want to pursue their interests, workers who need to keep up to date with their subject area, laid-off workers who need to retrain, etc.This means that we are constantly trying to think through how P2PU can be useful to different groups of people, and how to engage with those communities to collaborate and learn from each other. I&#039;ve had wonderful conversations with people working with disadvantaged youth, doing teacher training in developing countries, wanting to improve the efficiency of NGOs, or make university classes more international and interesting.As we are evaluating different communications/community platforms for P2PU, <a href=""http://www.johndbritton.com/"">John Britton</a> shared a link to OSQA, an open source platform for ""Q&amp;A"" &ndash; asking questions, getting answers, rating the best answers, gaining community credit (they have a neat system of badges, which plays into another aspect P2PU is investigating right now). While looking at their example sites, I came across a <a href=""http://homeschoolhelpdesk.com/"">very active forum</a> for <a href=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling"">homeschoolers</a>.This made me realize that homeschoolers represent one community that I had least had not thought about as a potential user of P2PU. It makes a lot of sense though, here are people who are very critical to the existing system (for a host of different reasons), who have thought and reflect a lot about the kind of education their kids should receive, and who are also eager to make formal systems &ndash; college or grad school admissions, and hiring processes &ndash; more open to non-traditional ways of gaining knowledge and skills.So I posted a question on the site, asking ""<a href=""http://homeschoolhelpdesk.com/question/153/how-could-peer2peer-university-be-of-help-to-homeschoolers"">How  could Peer2Peer University be of help to homeschoolers?</a>"" I also outlined a few possibilities that I see, but I really hope people will respond, because I would love to hear from these thoughtful and reflective individuals how we could be a positive resource to them.Let me know if you think of other groups out there that could benefit from P2PU &ndash; or whom P2PU is not serving well right now, and what kinds of changes and additions we would have to make, to serve that group better?Here is the text of the question that I posted:<hr /><strong><a href=""http://homeschoolhelpdesk.com/question/153/how-could-peer2peer-university-be-of-help-to-homeschoolers"">How   could Peer2Peer University be of help to homeschoolers?</a></strong>Hi all, this seems like an amazingly  helpful forum, and I hope this question is appropriate. I&#039;m involved  with a project called <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">Peer2Peer University</a>. We are a  number of people who come from the Open Educational Resources movement -  where MIT, Open University, Yale, but also individuals and  organizations, made large amounts of educational resources available for  free, and with open licenses.We thought this was wonderful, but for self-learners, it was very  difficult to find proper materials, and they lack the community to  provide motivation, feedback, etc. That&#039;s why we created P2PU. It&#039;s kind  of a platform for conducting online learning groups. Our course  organizers (who don&#039;t have to be experts) submit proposals for 6-week  courses, where all the curriculum resources have to be freely available  (we link to them). We are building up resources for course organizers to  improve their course design/facilitation skills, and we pair them up  with mentors that have already led classes before. Then the curriculum  goes out for community review.When a course is running, you apply to take part (not based on  previous education, but just that you show that you are  enthusiastic/committed to complete the course). The students do their  readings, watch videos, go through exercises etc in the curriculum, and  use forums, live chat, Skype and videochat, collaborative text editing,  blogs etc to communicate with each other. Everything is open, so you can  ""audit"" or peek into any class, even if you are not registered.We are also looking into ways in which the learning that happens can  later be recognized, formally or informally. For the formal route, we  are researching link ups with people like Kaplan or AP exams, competency  based curricula like Western Governors&#039; University, challenge exams,  recognition of prior learning etc, and for informal recognition, we are  looking at assembling electronic portfolios, measuring community  reputation, etc. (You can see a brief summary of our project <a href=""http://www.vimeo.com/11158136"">here</a>).So my question is, how could we serve the homeschooling community?  And what would we need to modify/add to be more useful to your needs? I  think we could learn a lot from each other, because we have the same  belief that education doesn&#039;t have to come pre-packaged in a  mass-produced fashion, and the same desire to open the system up to  recognizing different pathways students might choose, to reach the same  goals.Here are some ideas I have, please pitch in!<ul><li>The curricula that we generate are    useful in themselves. MIT has    curricula for 1800 courses online,    but they all link to 200$ textbooks,    and academic articles that you can    only get if you are at an academic    library. Our curricula only link to    free resources. So if you want to get    started with behavioural economics or    urban sustainability, we are a good    place to go (and will hopefully    become much better)</li><li>Students could    attend courses. We certainly pose no    age limits, but I&#039;m assuming this    would be most relevant to high-school    age students. It would be a great way    for them to get exposure to a larger    group of people, and age range, and    exercise their critical skills,    communication and writing skills,    etc.</li><li>Students could teach courses!    as I stated above, we are not looking    for experts, because in a course,    everyone learns (and in a way, the    course material we find to a certain    extent plays the role of the expert).    In this networked world, we also    shouldn&#039;t be shy about reaching out -    if you designed a curriculum for a    class, we can definitively find a    professor willing to have a look at    it, and maybe even come in for a    ""guest lecture"". This would be an    amazing experience, and growth    opportunity.</li><li>Another idea is to    facilitate courses for parents or    others involved in home schooling. I    am sure a common doubt is ""do I know    enough, am I doing it right""? This    project seems like an amazing    resource for asking questions and    getting help on specific issues, but    some people might be interested in    collecting some resources - maybe    Paolo Freire, maybe Ivan Illich,    maybe ""Homeschooling 101"", ""how to    teach your kid without going crazy""    etc, and studying them together,    while sharing resources.</li></ul>Anyway, I know I am an outside to this community, but please don&#039;t  perceive this as spam, I&#039;m genuinely interested in engaging with you,  and learning from your experiences, and perhaps seeing if we can work  together in some way.Stian","P2PU and Homeschoolers  => [...] 4, 2010 &middot; Leave a Comment  Stian Haklev has a new post wondering how P2PU can help homeschoolers.

"Open Access Journals: CC Bait and Switch?,"open access,p2pU,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/05/03/open-access-journals-cc-bait-and-switch/,"I&#039;m currently doing some surveying of the Open Access publishing landscape, together with a professor. We are trying to get a sense of the different actors, motivations, etc. We will be sharing much more from this research as it matures, but for now, I wanted to mention one thing that has come up frequently. I have been investigating a sample of OA journals, visiting their websites to gather basic statistics like whether they use open licenses or not, whether authors can keep their copyright or have to transfer it to the publisher, whether the publisher is for-profit or non-profit, etc.The first thing that I realized is that finding this information is very difficult. Some journal websites are very helpful, and spell it all out (these are typically templated web pages belonging to big publishers). For many others, you have to dig deep into the ""author&#039;s instructions"" PDF, to find the information you are looking for, and in many other cases, you cannot find it at all.When it comes to the use of open licenses, there is also a fair amount of confusion, and many web sites will have contradictory statements. To just choose one example (the last one I looked at, but there are <strong>many</strong> like this): <a href=""http://www.ijcep.com/"">The International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Pathology</a>. This journal is published by <a href=""http://e-century.org/"">e-Century Publishing Corporation</a>, a US corporation that publishes a total of six OA journals, with the slogan: ""Always Publishing, Always Open-Access / We are working towards the Freedom of Sciences"".The journal sustains itself on the publication fee, which is $900 for each paper accepted under ten pages, and $100 for each additional page. Given that all the articles are available for free download, it does fulfill the most narrow criteria of OA publishing. But does it also offer articles under an open license, allowing dissemination, even modification, translation, etc? According to their <a href=""http://www.ijcep.com/instructions.html"">Instructions to Authors</a>, yes.Here is their copyright policy in full:<strong>Copyright Policy</strong><em>By submitting a manuscript to IJCEP, all authors agree that all copyrights of all materials included in the submitted manuscript will be exclusively transferred to the publisher - e-Century Publishing Corporation once the manuscript is accepted.Once the paper is published, the copyright will be released by the publisher under the &ldquo;Creative Commons Attribution License&rdquo;, enabling the unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction of the published article in any medium, provided that the original work is properly cited.

If you are interested in using PDF, html, XML files or any art works published in this journal for any commercial purposes, please contact the publisher at business@e-century.org.</em>So, there are a few issues here. The journal requests you to transfer the copyright to them, and state that they will release the article under a <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"">CC BY license</a>, but then go on to state that this will enable unrestricted non-commercial usage of the article. However, the CC BY license does not restrict commercial usage. If they desired this, they would have to use the <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"">CC BY NC license</a>. They also state that all PDF, HTML and XML files will be the property of the publisher, and that permission is granted to use these for ""academic purposes"".This is confusing &ndash; are they saying that there is a difference between the copyright in the Platonic idea of the article, and the copyright on each of the individual expressions of that article? But if the article is only offered through HTML, PDF and XML, what does that mean? What if I took a picture, and said that the picture was freely licensed, by the JPEG I put on my website was copyrighted?How does this confusion play out in practice though &ndash; for most visitors, who don&#039;t stop to read the instructions for authors, but merely want to access the articles? Well, let us choose a random article, ""<a href=""http://www.ijcep.com/910004A.html"">Androgen deprivation and stem cell markers in prostate cancers</a>"", which is featured in the latest issue. Looking at the abstract page, there is no mention of an open license, only a line at the bottom stating ""IJCEP Copyright  2007-All rights reserved"". Nothing about right of reuse for academic purposes, etc. Let us download the <a href=""http://www.ijcep.com/files/IJCEP910004.pdf"">PDF</a>, and see if there is further information inside the actual article.There is no reference to any open license inside the PDF. In other words, this is a traditionally copyrighted article - no hint anywhere that other permissions might be granted, whether they be CC BY, or ""permission for academic reuse"". The confusing text in the instruction for authors might be specific to this journal, but the mention of a CC license in one place of the website, and no use of CC license on the actual article, happens quite often.Sometimes this is because the website inserts a copyright notice by default. University of Toronto&#039;s institutional repository <a href=""https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/"">T-Space</a> had this problem, it would show ""This item is licensed under Creative Commons BY"", and right below that a line saying ""Items in T-Space are protected by Copyright, with all rights reserved"". Now they have changed that last line to say ""unless otherwise noted"".Back to the journal business, there are two issues here. One is whether the stated intent in an information for authors PDF that articles will be released under CC BY is legally binding, and whether this in fact makes all articles on the site CC BY, even though this was not noted individually for each article. Regardless of this however, the whole point of CC licenses is to make it easy for people to copy, share, modify and distribute versions of the licensed material. If it&#039;s not clearly noted on the item (both on the abstract page, and in the PDF generated) that the item is licensed under CC, you lose all this benefit, and the item might just as well be copyrighted.This is all the more egregious, because this publisher in particular publishes 6 journals. I hope all OA journals can have a look at the information they make available, and clarify this, so that there is no doubt of the intention of the journal, whether for authors (I would be upset if I submitted my article to this journal, thinking it would be CC licensed, and then find the PDF distributed without any information about this), and for readers.Stian","houshuang => Daniel, I very much appreciate that your journals will stay OA. In my post, I highlighted two different things, one is that you had chosen a license that didn&#039;t seem to reflect your real intention. The second was that there was no mention of this license on the actual article page. After communicating with Dengshun Wang from your company, he has assured me that both of these issues will be rectified. That is great, and I am happy that you are so open to suggestions and advice.   I hope other publishers will follow your example.  Stian .

Personally I am a big fan of not including the non-commercial clause, but I certainly understand why they do so, and the most important thing is that they choose the CC license that is appropriate to them, and then use that consistently throughout the journal.The other issue was that it was not clear from just viewing the individual articles, that they had been licensed with an open license. It seems that the publisher will now change that, something that is very positive.There are many other journals out there that do the same thing, but this is one positive move from e-Century Publishing.

"Is TD &#8220;aapna&#8221; bank? Appealing to the South Asian community,"asia,canada,languages,toronto,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/05/03/is-td-aapna-bank-appealing-to-the-south-asian-community/,"I am trying to purchase a flight ticket, but because I am an international student, my credit limit is just 1000$, and the ticket costs 1,150$. The fact that I have over 10,000$ in my account is not important, I can&#039;t seem to buy this ticket. Since I have been a customer of <a href=""http://cibc.com"">CIBC</a>&#039;s for four years, had my VISA card for more than two years, and spent a lot of money (all promptly repaid), I find it insulting that they refuse to raise the limit. So I am planning to go talk to them, and tell them that I will switch banks, if they cannot provide me with a higher credit limit.To prepare, I thought I&#039;d visit some other Canadian banks to check out their offers. Yesterday, at a party, I also met a girl who works for TD, and sang their praises, so I thought I&#039;d see what kind of card deals they offer. However, when I went to the TD site, I became fascinated by something quite different.At the bottom of the front page, there is a headline ""Communities:"", and under that, links to ""Chinese, Japanese and South Asian"". I am always very fascinated by how companies and public services in Canada try to accommodate, or attract, different ethnic and linguistic groups (I have written about that before <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/01/10/providing-multilingual-services-if-the-iranian-can-do-it/"">here</a>), so I clicked the three links.The <a href=""http://www.tdcanadatrust.com/asian/index.jsp"">Chinese</a> and <a href=""http://www.tdcanadatrust.com/japanese/index.jsp"">Japanese</a> links simply led to pages introducing TD&#039;s services in Chinese (traditional) and Japanese. This made me very curious &ndash; what would be behind <a href=""http://www.tdcanadatrust.com/southasian/index.jsp"">the South Asian link</a>? After all, South Asia is an area famed for it&#039;s linguistic diversity, with not only a large array of languages, but even a large array of scripts.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-03-at-9.23.11-PM.png""><img class=""size-full wp-image-517 alignnone"" title=""Banking can be itna comfortable"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-03-at-9.23.11-PM.png"" alt=""Banking can be itna comfortable"" width=""419"" height=""202"" /></a>Turns out, the website is in ""Hinglish"" &ndash; English, interspersed with snippets of Hindi, written in the Latin script. So, the picture exclaims ""Banking can be itna comfortable"" (itna = so), and the following paragraph states:<blockquote>TD Canada Trust is the <strong>sab se  aasaan</strong>, convenient and secure way to handle your everyday banking,  investment and credit needs. Ever since we first opened our doors in  1855, <strong>ek cheez kabhi nahi badli</strong> &ndash; our commitment to our customers, our  employees and the community. At TD Canada Trust, our goal is to provide a  positive banking experience for each and every customer.</blockquote>(My highlights). Sab se aasaan &ndash; the most easy, ek cheez kabhi nahi badli &ndash; one thing has never changed (will never change?).The page continues like this, with lot&#039;s of information about their services, interspersed with short snippets of Hindi. We find out that ""Banking with us is <strong>behtherien aur aasaan</strong>"" (better and easy), they offer a list of ""<strong>Sawaal-Jawaab</strong>"" (questions and answers). And among their services, we see that ""Telephone <strong>ya</strong> Internet <strong>se banking  karne ki suvidha</strong> &ndash; that&rsquo;s the  covenience of <em>EasyLine</em> telephone banking and <em>EasyWeb</em> Internet banking with TD Canada Trust."" (the facility to bank with internet or telephone).<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-03-at-9.24.48-PM.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-519"" title=""Aapke sawaal, hamare jawaab"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-03-at-9.24.48-PM.png"" alt=""Aapke sawaal, hamare jawaab"" width=""414"" height=""194"" /></a>So what is the purpose of this? The words that are in Hindi are the most easy words, so it&#039;s clearly not to make it easier to understand for someone who doesn&#039;t speak English very well. Rather, it&#039;s to make the bank seem friendly and welcoming to a ""South Asian"" community. I have a few questions:<ul><li>How natural does the text seem to a native Hindi speaker? Although I know that this is often done by the educated classes in India, who speak Hindi mixing in English, or English mixing in Hindi, this text doesn&#039;t look quite natural. It seems a bit like someone took an English text, and added a few ""ethnic"" touches. Sort of like when the government is putting out a youth-oriented PSA (<a href=""http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/02/21/std-brochure-targeting-hip-hop-community/"">about STDs for example</a>), and inserts some ""dude"", ""yo"". It doesn&#039;t come across as authentic to the recipient.</li><li>How is this perceived by non-Hindi speaking Indians and other South Asians? I have certainly seen ad campaigns with Hindi words in Latin script all over India, so it is quite possible that most Indians would be familiar with simple words like ""aasaan"" (simple), ""bahut"" (a lot), etc. But do they perceive this as imposing a Hindi-chauvinism, or does it make them nostalgic for ""India""? How about groups from outside India? Pakistan (although they mainly speak Panjabi and Urdu, which are very similar to Hindi in this simplified, latinized form), Bangladesh (Bengali, again in the same language family, although a bit further away), Sri Lanka (Tamil and Sinhalese &ndash; all extremely different from Hindi)?</li></ul>I have seen other ad campaigns in Toronto do this, mix in a few Hindi words to appeal to a certain community. But this is the first time I&#039;ve seen it under the sub-heading ""the South Asian community"" &ndash; meaning it purports to represent all South Asians.I know, if you addresses this to ""the Nordic Community"", and wrote the whole text in Swedish, Norwegians might feel a bit miffed.Is there even such a thing as a ""South Asian community""? Certainly, in the region, there is a lot of enmity between some people from different groups, for example between India and Pakistan, and even within India between different religions, ethnic groups etc. Do these fade away when people end up in Toronto, and they find that there are more important commonalities than differences?And how did the bank choose to address these three communities? (I am especially surprised by the Japanese addition &ndash; I can understand Chinese and South Asian, but I didn&#039;t realize there were that many Japanese here). Is it purely based on demographic? (<a href=""http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/tbt/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=838003&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=1&amp;PID=89186&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=88971,97154&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;THEME=70&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF="">The most frequently spoken language in Toronto after English is Italian</a>, but they don&#039;t have their own section). Or based on which groups have the most problems with understanding English (clearly not the case with the South Asian example). Or the most wealthy/profitable customers?Stian","Casual Reader => A native Hindi speaker here. It&#039;s what you think it is - ""a bit like someone took an English text, and added a few &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; touches."" The Hindi phrases (the ones you have highlighted) in themselves are fine and natural. It&#039;s a token gesture. People not knowing English wouldn&#039;t understand what is being said, but they might get attracted to it seeing the Hindi phrases. Also, by using the Roman script for Hindi words they can justify the ""South Asian"" tag since people from Pakistan will easily understand those phrases as well. They are as much Urdu as Hindi.. Prashanth Ellina => The Hindi phrases seem natural enough to me. (I am from India but not a native speaker of Hindi) . "What is happening with Universal Library? Open letter to Dr. Raj Reddy at CMU,"books,china,India,languages,open access,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/05/03/what-is-happening-with-universal-library/,"I am very interested in book scanning projects, and especially in making books in different languages available to the world. I&#039;ve written before about my <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/02/google-books-step-aside-openlibrary-makes-reading-fun/"">enthusiasm around the OpenLibrary project</a>, and also my wish to <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/11/09/whats-happening-with-openlibrary-and-oca/"">find out more about the process/get involved</a>. Since then, there have been many improvements in interface, additions of new books etc, but I still wish the process was more transparent.I was also very excited when I first heard about <a href=""http://www.ulib.org"">Universal Library</a>, which promised access to a huge range of books in Chinese, Indic languages and Arabic. However, the interface was extremely difficult to use, thus rendering this treasure-trove inaccessible to those who need it (indeed, how many Indians or Chinese have even heard about this project?). This seems like a criminal waste, when the hard work of scanning the books has already been completed! I&#039;ve argued previously that <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/08/03/openlibrary-and-universal-library-guys-work-together/"">OpenLibrary and Universal Library should join forces</a>, given that the Open Library already has a great interface/infrastructure.Yet nothing seems to be happening around Universal Library - <a href=""http://www.ulib.org/ULIBProgressReport.htm"">the website</a> still has not been updated since 2007(!), and now most of the links to books seem to be broken. There are some interesting tidbits: it seems like they are indeed working together with <a href=""http://www.opencontentalliance.org/"">Open Content Alliance</a>, and a bit over 40,000 books have <a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/universallibrary"">been added to the Internet Archive</a>. This is great news, and enables me to read books like <a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/06040807.cn"">this</a>. However, the process seems to have stalled - the last import was 189 days ago. And there is very little meta-data enabling you to browse or find interesting books.I also found that the <a href=""http://www.cadal.zju.edu.cn/"">Chinese chapter</a> based at Zhejiang University seems to be very active &ndash; all the information there is in Chinese, but I found descriptions of a national meeting to be held this year, hiring several people, having more university libraries start scanning, etc. However, much of it seemed like it was designed for a platform that was closed to non-participating institutions, and indeed, when I search among the ""classical works"" on their website (which should not have copyright issues) and click on a book, I get ""Your IP does not have permission to access this"".So again, I think this project has amazing potential, and indeed since much of the scanning has been done, it seems almost criminal to leave it without making those books available to the world. I wrote an e-mail to the project founder <a href=""http://www.rr.cs.cmu.edu/"">Dr. Raj Reddy</a> at Carnegie Mellon back in November 2009, to ask about the progress, and never heard back. (I also wrote to the head of the project in India, Dr. Balakrishnan, to ask about this, but also did not hear back from him).Whether these two distinguished professors, who have made great contributions to opening up information, respond to my private e-mail, is not important at all. But I think everyone in China, and India, and the US (whose governments all spent significant amounts of money to enable this project) deserve to know how it is going. If there are some obstacles to enabling the free and easy access to these books &ndash; perhaps we can help! The open community is a pretty amazing and resourceful community, if you give us a chance!Below is a reprint of my letter to Dr. Raj Reddy.<hr /><span style=""color: #000080;"">Dear Professor Reddy,</span><span style=""color: #000080;"">I am long-term advocate of open education and open access, and I conduct research on international OER projects.

I speak Chinese fluently, and am currently learning Hindi, so this was also of much interest to me personally.</span><span style=""color: #000080;"">However, I am writing to you to enquire about the progress of this project.

The Open Library (http://openlibrary.org/), which is a project with very similar goals and ideas, have developed wonderful software for user friendly display of books. Ideally, since the books are outside of copyright, it would also be great to provide PDF downloads for people who want to read on other devices (this is of course especially important in developing countries such as India, where internet accessibility is very limited).</span><span style=""color: #000080;"">I think this is an incredibly inspiring project, and I am very excited about it. However, I am concerned that it seems to have stagnated.

He takes out the detailed table of contents for each book (<a href=""http://www.notemonk.com/book/40/Chemistry%201%20Class%2011/"">example</a>), and for each chapter, collects relevant videos (like MIT OpenCourseWare, and other open lectures), and enable people to ask and answer questions (<a href=""http://www.notemonk.com/node/1887/Modern.Periodic.Law.and.the.present.form.of.the.Pe/"">example</a>).<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-04-at-12.08.56-PM.png""><img class=""alignleft  size-full wp-image-539"" style=""margin: 5px;"" title=""Screen shot 2010-05-04 at 12.08.56 PM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-04-at-12.08.56-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""289"" height=""78"" /></a>I think this is a great example of remixing open resources, and I am excited to see where Prashanth will take the project. Since neither the open textbooks in India, nor his project, is very well known internationally, I asked if he would agree to do an e-mail interview. He graciously agreed, and below you can see him introducing his project in detail. Visit <a href=""http://www.notemonk.com/"">Notemonk</a> and <a href=""http://www.notemonk.com/feedback/"">let him know what you think</a>!<hr /><strong>Who are you?</strong>I am an entrepreneur working out of Bangalore, India. I co-founded Headrun Technologies Pvt Ltd to pursue various innovative trajectories under one umbrella. Prior to this I worked as a software developer at <a href=""http://corporate.veveo.net/"">Veveo</a> (A technology startup HQ&#039;ed in Boston, USA). I consider myself an ardent supporter of the Open Source Movement and try to aid by releasing code to the general public every once in a while through my <a href=""http://blog.prashanthellina.com"">blog</a>. I am at the stage of awakening to the Open Education arena and I believe there are exciting things happening and even more yet to happen over here.<strong>When did you first come across these open textbooks? How? What was your first thought? What did you think about the content, and about the site itself?</strong>About 3 years back I felt an urge to re-read my school textbooks hoping to learn the same information but with new perspectives. Simultaneously I was also looking for people with similar motivations online. While searching I came across <a href=""http://www.ncert.nic.in/index.htm"">NCERT</a>&#039;s excellent resource and was thrilled to know that the Indian Government was providing easy access to beautifully designed text books. The NCERT text books are fantastic. They are much improved compared to when I was in school. The site itself looks and feels like a relic out of the earlier days of the internet.<a href=""http://www.ncert.nic.in/index.htm""></a><strong>How did you get the idea of making an alternative site to make these resources available (your first site)?</strong>I starting reading the books after downloading from the <a href=""http://www.ncert.nic.in/"">NCERT site</a> and realized quickly that a better organized site would make it easier to access the books. Initially it was to be just a personal library interface and then I thought it might actually be useful to others so I hosted it on my website.<strong>How did you do it? Was it a lot of work?</strong>At the time my day job involved a insane amount of Python/Linux hacking, CGI&#039;s, System infrastructure building, Web back-ends etc. So I knew exactly the right tools and methods to get the job done. I spend about 3-4 evenings after work to get <a href=""http://ncertbooks.prashanthellina.com"">the first site</a><a href=""http://ncertbooks.prashanthellina.com""></a> done.<strong>Did you receive any feedback, were there many users?</strong>The interesting thing is that I wrote the site and put it up for general access and then completely forgot about it :) I was debugging something else on the website a few months later and happened to look at the Apache logs and found a steady stream of visitors pouring in. That is when I realized that there was a ""need"" for this resource.Looking back I got almost no feedback which I think is mostly because I did not provide an easily visible email address or feedback form.<strong>Are these resources openly licensed? Do you fear any legal problems? Have you had any contact officially with the people behind that website?</strong>The legality is in the grey. I looked around for licensing terms on the NCERT page at the time and found no explicit document or text. However, I received assurance that the material is intended to be open, and I am  working with them (NCERT) to have it explicitly stated as such on the  site.<strong>How did you get the idea of Notemonk? Was this the plan all along, or did you first do the first website, and then get this idea?</strong>When studying text books in school my father taught me to first understand the scope of the book by looking at the contents page and then to skim through the book looking at the main topics and their subtopics. I would do one or two iterations of this process until the ""Framework"" of the book fit into my mind. This is incredibly useful because any content you consume from the book thereafter fits into the appropriate niche in the mind. This is the way I read any book thereafter (except for books where suspense has to be savoured :)).This was one fundamental drive. Another one is a more recent feeling. When in school and college I realized two things. Firstly, the staff was underqualified and ill-equipped to act as agents of learning. That was mostly due to the economic conditions which paid teachers far less than in the Industry. Secondly, most students would not learn about things because they weren&#039;t excited enough about understanding things. This is both due to lack of exposure and to lack of proper training. Education was simply not made enough fun for them. The proliferation of online communities in the form of Forums, Social Networks coupled with Online Video coupled with the above seeded a subconcious thought that something could be done to harness new age technologies to solve this age old problem.So, after watching <a href=""http://ncertbooks.prashanthellina.com"">the first site</a> grow and attract people, I thought of experimenting with the ideas I&#039;ve had for a while. That is when I started building <a href=""http://www.notemonk.com"">Notemonk</a>.<strong>Who is the target group for Notemonk? How do you see people using it?</strong>Right now we are looking at engaging school students from India using NCERT text books. However we are already working on making the site more generic so we can support more syllabi from across the country and beyond. <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/19/407-indonesian-textbooks-openly-available/"">Indonesia has put up textbooks online</a>. Tamil Nadu (a state in South India) <a href=""http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/"">has also done the same</a>. We are going to make those accessible on Notemonk. At some point we want to actively involve teachers too.It has been just a month since we launched the site and we have 500+ registered users and fledgling community asking questions and answering on various books and topics across the site.<strong>What is some of the unique functionality you offer?</strong><ul><li>Book outlines and discussion pages for every topic in the outline</li><li>Ability for Q&amp;A on any topic.</li><li>Users can write notes on any topic and others can benefit by reading those.</li><li>Every topic has associated Videos from Youtube. Users can suggest more videos too.</li><li>A powerful notification system ensures students get emails when a book they are ""following"" has some activity - e.g. Followers get emails notifying them about new notes added or questions answered under the book.</li><li>A basic social networking framework to help people find like-minded learners and to follow their activity.</li><li>An innovative and fair ""points"" system to assess the user&#039;s contribution to the community (You can read <a href=""http://www.notemonk.com/book/72/Help.on.Notemonk/"">this</a> to get a better idea of the scoring system)</li><li>A redemption scheme - We share revenue with all users in the form of ""credits"". A user with more ""points"" has a chance of earning more ""credits"". A user can exchange his credits at Notemonk for a variety of gifts. We&#039;ve designed this to be a formalized method to thank the community players on a monthly basis.</li><li>We are actively working on adding more features.</li></ul><strong>What is the business model? Is this something you are doing purely voluntarily or would you like to make money in the future?</strong>We do plan to monetize this in the future although all the base features will be free for all for ever. We&#039;ve identified a few business trajectories but what we put in place will depend on the learning we are deriving right now. We are firm believers of the fact that a solid business can keep churning out quality products and feature sets for the benefit of consumers and are working hard to get there. Right now our focus rests solely on making a highly relevant and useable service.<strong>How can you afford to <a href=""http://www.notemonk.com/node/2772/Credits/"">hand out stuff to people</a> if they get enough points?</strong>It is a revenue sharing programme. Right now we do not have any revenue so we are investing for now and plan to continue to do so until we can get revenue started. If we make 5000 Rs running the site in a given month and decide to share 50% with the community that makes it Rs 2500 for that month. This amount is distributed to users based on their overall score. Users can either choose to redeem right away or wait to accumulate enough credits over many months.<strong>What do you think of the potential of open educational resources in general, especially in India? And what about the sites where they are usually hosted?</strong>The disparity between the number of people with quality knowledge and those without is very high. Traditional methods of learning involving going to schools and universities are not scaling as much as we would like them to. South India alone has nearly a thousand engineering colleges but even these are not able to provide education to all. Also, most of them are ill-equipped to train students owing to lack of trained staff and facilities. The same applies to primary and secondary schooling.Open educational resources have the potential to make a real change in this space. If we can create the right tools and generate enough awareness thus connecting students to the tools, there is immense potential to revolutionize education and improve penetration to previously unthinkable levels.Existing Open education resources are more concerned about making content available to students. This is a great place to start because content comes first. Most sites seem to be at this stage of development. I believe that we need to fasttrack to the next stage - creation of interaction models around content. Imagine being able to create a rich interaction model like that of Facebook only in the space of educational material. A framework within which students can be exposed to educational content, peers and seasoned teachers from across the world.<strong>Anything else you want to add?</strong>Yes. A call for help!We are building a rich feature set along with a carefully crafted interaction model for Notemonk. Please consider dropping by at the site to get a feel for it. We would love to <a href=""http://www.notemonk.com/feedback/"">hear from you</a>.<hr>Thank you very much to Prashanth for agreeing to the interview, and best of luck with his venture. I think these kinds of aggregations of OER around certain topics (in this case, TOCs of common textbooks) is great. Students are not that concerned about which university the video comes from, they just want to watch it. However, it would be very useful to slice up the videos in smaller segments &ndash; 10, 20 minute pieces that each explain one concept. People who want to see the whole lecture could still subscribe to a play list, but if you are just studying the zinc substrates, you could plug in exactly that part of the lecture relevant to the chapter.Stian","RANJAN V GAUR => A hidden need of lakhs of students well identified.

"How to cite Chinese sources in Chicago style,"academia/research,china,languages,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/05/06/how-to-cite-chinese-sources-in-chicago-style/,"I am always interested in improving my academic ""workflow"", new neat tools that can help me keep track of all my notes, PDFs, drafts, citations, etc. I use<a href=""http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/""> DevonThink</a> to keep most of my PDFs, and a lot of web pages, as well as most of my research notes. I then transfer these over to <a href=""http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html"">Scrivener</a> for the actual writing. Scrivener is an absolutely amazing product, that has really changed the way I write &ndash; and all the friends I&#039;ve shown it to, have begun using it as well. I could never imagine going back to unwieldy Word.The one thing I&#039;ve been holding back on, is a reference manager. I went through a spell during my BA Honors thesis, when I downloaded and tried a whole raft of programs, but I could never find one that suited my style and wasn&#039;t slowing me down during my writing. So the whole thing was done by hand, which worked &ndash; although when I later split it into two articles, both needing just a subset of the citations, and in different formats, it was a real pain.Currently, I am just starting on the writing phase for my MA thesis (I&#039;ve been doing the research for the last two years), and I thought it would be worth checking again. I had looked at <a href=""http://www.sonnysoftware.com/"">Bookends</a> before, but maybe it&#039;s because it has improved since last time, or that I had a better idea of my needs &ndash; this time I felt I could really use it. So I bought a license, and began reading the manual and looking at how I could integrate it with my workflow.One of my big issues last time I investigated these programs, was that I felt that they put me in a strait-jacket with their definitions of publication types. I want to register this as a newspaper article &ndash; but I also want to specify the URL where I found it. In Bookends, you can add and modify all the built-in publication types, and even create your own, so you could add a URL field to the ""newspaper"" type.I have also been struggling with how to deal with citations in foreign languages, and specifically Chinese. My thesis is about higher education in China, and I will be citing many Chinese journal articles and reports. It has always annoyed me how most books about China only use transliterated (pinyin) Chinese in their citations, telling you that Li, X. (2010) wrote a paper about ""Shuini de fazhan"" in ""Xiandai Shuini Zazhi"". Often you can fairly easily guess what characters the pinyin represent, but not always. And with a truncated author name like Li, X., it would be almost impossible to find other articles by the same author.So I was wondering if the big citation styles, APA and Chicago, etc, had said anything about including Chinese characters into the bibliography. At that time, I asked several people, and even sent an e-mail to the Asia library, but found no answer, or mention of it. Today, I stumbled over <a href=""http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/ch10/ch10_sec108.html"">a passage</a> in the Chicago Style handbook, which I will paste here (since it&#039;s behind a paywall):<blockquote><strong>10.108: Inclusion of original characters</strong>Chinese and Japanese characters, immediately following the romanized version of the item they represent, are sometimes necessary to help readers identify references cited or terms used. They are largely confined to bibliographies and glossaries. Where needed in running text, they may be enclosed in parentheses. Computer technology has made it much easier than it used to be to typeset words in non-Latin alphabets.Hua Linfu 華林甫, &ldquo;Qingdai yilai Sanxia diqu shuihan zaihai de chubu yanjiu&rdquo; 清代以來三峽地區水旱災害的初步硏究 [A preliminary study of floods and droughts in the Three Gorges region since the Qing dynasty], Zhongguo shehui kexue 中國社會科學 1 (1999): 168&ndash;79 . . .Harry Harootunian and Sakai Naoki, &ldquo;Nihon kenkyū to bunka kenkyū 日本研究と文化研究, Shisō 思想 7 (July 1997): 4&ndash;53.That year the first assembly of the national Diet was held and the Imperial Rescript on Education (kyōiku chokugo 敎育勅語) issued.</blockquote>So they do allow you to do this! Assuming that my graduate school accepts Chicago Style, I now have a legitimate way of doing this in my MA thesis.And since Bookends is so flexible, I was able to clone the Chicago B style, insert a few custom types, and register this information whenever I type in new citations. Changing the output format, I was able to generate a citation that looks exactly like the format above. However, if I should ever be submitting to a journal that doesn&#039;t like this format, it&#039;s done in a few seconds to switch the entire bibliography to another format.Brilliant. I also like how Bookends let&#039;s you insert simple ""temporary references"", either auto-generated or handwritten by you, such as {Boyle, 1980}. These are just plain text, and work well in Scrivener, travels well from one editing software to another etc, and when you are finally done, you can just run the file through Bookends to have it all expanded and formatted. Very clean and nice, compared to some of the solutions that integrate deep within OpenOffice or Word, which I have had poor experiences with.So now I just have to sit down and write this thesis...Stian",Around the world with Cory Doctorow&#8217;s writings,"books,languages,libraries,open access,personal,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/05/12/around-the-world-with-cory-doctorows-writing/,"<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-12-at-1.57.28-PM.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-552"" title=""Screen shot 2010-05-12 at 1.57.28 PM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-12-at-1.57.28-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""203"" height=""173"" /></a>I am a big fan of <a href=""http://craphound.com/"">Cory Doctorow</a>&#039;s work. Without planning to, I have actually read his entire oeuvres on screen. If I ever came across a paper copy of one of his books, I would love to pick it up, but I haven&#039;t seen one at the airports I frequent. It started when I was living in China in 2004, I downloaded<a title=""Permanent Link to Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom"" rel=""bookmark"" href=""http://craphound.com/?p=147""> Down and Out  in the Magic Kingdom</a> and <a title=""Permanent Link to Eastern Standard Tribe"" rel=""bookmark"" href=""http://craphound.com/?p=148"">Eastern Standard Tribe</a>, and read them both on my 17"" creaky Linux laptop, using a program that very much resembles <a href=""http://amarsagoo.info/tofu/"">Tofu</a> for Mac - full-screen reading with columns and no scrolling (I hate scrolling when reading a lot of text).At that time, I was very excited by the idea that I could read interesting, cutting edge stuff in English while living in China - in the bookstores the only thing I could find were English novels that had entered the public domain, Pride and prejudice and so on.After finishing the two books, I breathlessly sent an e-mail to Cory to express my appreciation:<blockquote><span style=""color: #333399;"">Mar 31, 2004, at 5:59: <strong>Enjoyed your book</strong></span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""color: #333399;"">Hey,</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">just wanted to drop you a quick note, while it&#039;s still fresh in my mind,  that I really enjoyed your book. It&#039;s 0:40 at night here in Hangzhou,  China where I currently reside, and I just watched the last page on my  laptop. In fact, it&#039;s also the first _fiction book_ I&#039;ve read in  entirety on my laptop (I&#039;ve obviously read page upon page upon page of  other material). The use of a freeware reader (ubook) that let&#039;s me flip  pages instead of scroll, helped a lot, in fact I got really into the  book, as I was curled up on my couch. </span><span style=""color: #333399;"">This is one book that I probably would&#039;ve never read, if it were not  publicly available - I live in China currently, where I certainly  wouldn&#039;t be able to buy it, neither would it be available, I suspect, in  Norway, where I was born. In a few months I am moving to Toronto to  study, there I might even have the chance to catch you at a reading,  which would be fun. Anyhow, I found your site through the Lessig-reading  project on AKMA&#039;s blog (which I don&#039;t even remember how I found), which  I thought was really cool. I really support the CC license, and marvel  at the imagination and cooperation that it unleashes at its best. One  point about copyright that is seldom mentioned in the discussions I&#039;ve  read online - which tend to be very US-centric - is the developing  world. </span><span style=""color: #333399;"">My girlfriend downloads Sex and the City, and Friends online  (illegally of course) and thus has access to ways of thinking that are  not readily available in this country (for us it might not be a big  deal, but for her it is important). In China, hundreds of millions of  people study English, probably more than the population of the US, yet  in the bookstores they only have access to either very expensive  imported books (in very big cities), or Chinese reprints of out of  copyright Western classics (like Gone with the Wind - I&#039;ve read several  of these ""gems"" being in China, out of pure desperation). Not everyone  has a computer of course, but it is spreading, and computer cafes are  everywhere. Somebody just need to ship some of those ""book-making""  machines that print out whole books with hardcover and everything and we  can open (legally) shop... </span><span style=""color: #333399;"">Anyhow, you are as I gather one of the few authors that can actually  make a living from what they do, but I see one of the main functions of  the CC as helping to share all the stuff that isn&#039;t really going to make  much direct money anyway - like when I download a group from the CC  music archive, a group from some town in the States that I find I really  like -- these guys haven&#039;t even got an album out, and if they did, do  you think I could find it in Norway? They make a living playing bars in  their town, and probably even benefit a bit from their publicity. But  thanks to this, I can now listen to and enjoy them in Norway. In my  view, that is making the world richer. Now, if only we could figure out  how to put out a bread and wine bittorrent ( <a href=""http://feedthehungry.net/"" target=""_blank"">feedthehungry.net</a> :))</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">Keep up the good work, hope I&#039;ll be able to catch you when you&#039;re in  Toronto some time, and I do hope you&#039;re second book isn&#039;t as good as the  first, otherwise I shall get very little sleep tonight. </span><span style=""color: #333399;"">thanks, </span><span style=""color: #333399;"">Stian HaklevHangzhou, China</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">PS: Don&#039;t feel required to reply, just wanted to let you know.</span></blockquote>Cory graciously wrote back and said he couldn&#039;t make a living off books either, he was working for the <a href=""http://www.eff.org/"">EFF</a>, and that he&#039;d be moving to England, and hoped I&#039;d like his other books.I kept up with his short stories, his posts on <a href=""http://boingboing.net/"">Boing Boing</a> and so on, and a few years later I&#039;m a BA student (mature :) at University of Toronto, and I&#039;m doing an internship at a <a href=""http://www.healthwrights.org/projects/projimo/projimo.htm"">co-op</a> of disabled (but more able than most of us - I can&#039;t weld a wheel chair from metal tubes!) in Northern Mexico. Part of my job was to help them rehabilitate the internet cafe (which they used themselves, and which was also a source of income, and encouraged interaction between all the kids in town, and the people living in the co-op).<a href=""http://craphound.com/someone""><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" title=""Cover Someone comes to town"" src=""http://craphound.com/images/someonecovermainsite.jpg"" alt="""" width=""192"" height=""291"" /></a>We helped them set up a satellite link, so their internet wouldn&#039;t go down every time it rained (their phone lines were quite ... cantankerous), and I remember sitting in the lab, helping them work on their webpages, when I saw a notice that <a title=""Permanent Link to Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town"" rel=""bookmark"" href=""http://craphound.com/?p=150"">Someone  Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town</a> had been posted online. I pulled up the first page on my screen, to read the introduction, and I couldn&#039;t stop. I think I sat in that shack the entire day, until I finished the book and my eyes hurt.I loved that the story was happening in Toronto, in Kensington Market. I had spent a year at UofT, but living at the suburban Scarborough campus. In fall, I was due to move downtown - in fact, to Kensington Market (the coolest place in Toronto). I even looked up the location of the house mentioned in the novel, on Google Maps. And although the concept of a washing machine and a mountain procreating was a bit weird to me, I loved the urban activism, the beautiful love story, the kids creating mesh networks...A year later, I was in Indonesia, working for <a href=""http://www.careindonesia.or.id/http://www.careindonesia.or.id/"">CARE</a>. While there, I began thinking a lot about offline access to material (since I suddenly didn&#039;t have internet at home anymore). When I got sick, I ended up listening to a lot of lectures by Cory, and they inspired me to write another (and much longer) e-mail to Cory:<span style=""color: #333399;""> </span><blockquote><span style=""color: #333399;"">Mar 4, 2007 at 10:19: <strong>Re: Enjoyed your book</strong></span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""color: #333399;"">Hey Cory, just thought I&#039;d send you a little note with some thoughts after spending the last two-three days listening to approximately twelve hours of your lectures :)</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">I remember writing you a note about three years ago, when I read two of your novels (one about Disneyland and one about timezone cliques) online while living in a small apartment in Hangzhou, China. Later, as I was volunteering in a small community in Mexico, I read your novel set partly in Kensington Street in Toronto, and absolutely loved it! At the time (still, technically) I was studying at UofT (Int&#039;l dev&#039;l studies), and after that summer (in Mexico) I actually moved into a shared apartment in Kensington market (right across from the Supermarket bar, if you&#039;ve been there recently). I always love place-specific literature (or movies) (indeed I think it&#039;s horribly sad that English-speaking Canada doesn&#039;t have more specifically local culture - there are some awesome movies that could be made in Canada, love stories in Scarborough, action thrillers in the CN Tower), and ever since I began living in Toronto I&#039;ve been looking for cultural references to the place.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">Currently, I&#039;m in Jakarta, Indonesia - on an internship with CARE from UofT, and I just spent the last three days sick, and listening to your first six lectures from PWNED (lucky I randomly downloaded them the day before I became sick - no internet at home). While very little of the material was genuinely new to me - I even remember when I heard about some of it (like listening to an IT conversations about feral robotic dogs on a Greyhound from Toronto to Buffalo to see my girlfriend), it was a nice companion when I got sick of watching HK and Korean pirate movies (which I&#039;d also unconsciously stocked up on a few days earlier).</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">Thanks for putting the material up there by the way. A funny feature of listening to so many lectures almost back to back - very different from how it&#039;s consumed in a class - is that you notice things. Like the few times when you repeat an anecdote or a metaphore almost verbatim. I do that myself. Indeed I remember while teaching English at university in China, where I was teaching 7 classes on the same level (a 45 students), and before I had really gotten organized, and was still experimenting with all kinds of stuff (no textbooks of course), I asked the class very clearly ""have I done the lesson on this yet?"" No response. ""Have we ever talked about this?"" no... There was even another teacher present, who had been observing the class for the semester. After this, I did the two hour lesson plan enthusiastically, with anecdotes, exercises, group tasks etc. At the end of the class, it turned out that I had given exactly the same lesson to the same class a week before. The Chinese teacher said that ""probably you should have changed it at least a bit"". I was quite ashamed, and a bit annoyed that not even the teacher had bothered to tell me. Then again, they probably didn&#039;t take it so hard, because they are very used to repetition. And I am not accusing you of anything as silly as this. :)</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">Anyway two short comments on the course material. In the first lecture you talk about renting and owning - from the perspective of DRM and software services, but also drawing in a bunch of real life metaphors, and concluding that renting is for poor people (or corporate) and everyone really wants to own. Perhaps my point isn&#039;t even very relevant, but I think there are a bunch of times when renting, or owning cooperatively or whatever makes a lot of sense. (Yes I used to be a communist/anarchist, and I&#039;m still on the left, although much more complicated). One good example are car-pools, both communal and the new corporate ones like Zipcar and stuff. You might need a car just once in a while, but if the choice is to own one or NOT to have access altogether, you would probably choose to buy one (if you could afford it). If the option was to only pay for usage, not only would you not have to buy one (thus reducing the amount of cars produced, and perhaps also the amount of people driving around with old cars), but you would probably also use it less. Is it technically more practical for you to own one than to rent one - in that you can use it whenever you please? Yes. But to me that is a too selfish argument that doesn&#039;t take into consideration all the costs.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">In the same way, and this might be a very Scandinavian mindset (I&#039;m Norwegian), I&#039;d love to share a lot of life&#039;s necessities. As a young single man, I live with friends, and we share kitchen utensils, a TV in the living room, an exercise machine, etc. On a bigger scale, in the Scandinavian countries, it&#039;s very common for people living in apartment buildings (they often own their own apartments, but these are very simple things - not at all this whole condo concept that I&#039;ve never understood from Canada/US) to share a lot of things between the whole house. Like having a bunch of industrial clothes washers in the basement. And a room that is heated with an air-dehumidifier, where you can hang your clothes. Every single Finnish apartment complex has a sauna in the basement. In some Swedish cities they have community centers where you can borrow tools. On WorldChanging they wrote lately that the average American power drill is used for six minutes during its lifetime.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">I understand that the American inclination (I&#039;m not saying this is necessarily your inclination) is to make so much money that you can buy an extensively big house in the suburbs, fill it to the rafters with clothes washers, power drills and five TVs, and then drive your SUV to town. But that&#039;s not my ideal life. I want to live in an affordable apartment complex downtown in a lively and vibrant cosmopolitan city, where I have access to the things I need in life - whether a car once in a while (I cannot drive, but still), a power drill, a sauna or washing my clothes. I would even love to put a mini movie theater (that could play anything) in the basement, with an LCD projector and a DVD player, and let people sign up for it. I would find it over-the-top to invest in this for my own place, but sharing it with fifty others, and being able to use it once in a while... In a big apartment complex in Sweden (but very affordable, as mentioned) they even had a guest room that could be rented for 10$ plus an extra 5$ for sheets by anyone who lived there and signed up. Beautiful for the people who want to live small - but still have space to put uncle up when he comes by.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">(Maybe you were completely aware and completely support all of this, and maybe not. I just felt like pointing it out. And I&#039;m still against DRM :) Although I think software as web services, which don&#039;t require companies doing weird stuff to your computer (although it unfortunately usually requires you to store your data online - which has very big implications) is going to get a lot bigger.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">The second point was related to pirated DVDs. I&#039;ve been quite interested in the pirate DVD market in Indonesia for a while, and also asked a few of my local friends, one director and one underground filmmaker. Partly, they say most of the DVDs are made in Hong Kong or Bangkok, partly they also say that individual sellers are usually under local ""preman"" (kind of local ruffians/mafia). But I don&#039;t think the preman controls the distribution system, I think they are more about real-estate protectionist rackets. I would love to read a long detailed article about how the whole chain works, who decides which works to provide, how it moves down the chain.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">Part of the reason it&#039;s done centralized is that it has to be translated to Indonesian, because the selection is staggering (they even have their own ""festival"" racks, with stuff from Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Turkey), and many times bigger than the number of officially imported and published Hollywood movies (that already have official Indonesian translations). Usually the DVDs here come with subtitles in English, Indonesian, Chinese (two versions) and Thai. (Sometimes Malay instead of Indonesian, which are mutually intelligible). Of course, the translations are usually completely horrible, indeed on one they had used an automated translation program to get the English subtitles back from the Indonesian translation (this was an original American movie) - I know this because odd misspelled Indonesian words made it through to the English translation - it had just been ignored by the translation program.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">I am interested in this partly out of interest, partly because I am wondering whether it would be possible to harness this amazingly efficient chain of cheap DVD distributors - available everywhere at prices that are accessible to normal people (around 60 cents for a DVD) - to distribute other stuff. I recently subtitled a Norwegian movie in Indonesian with a friend, and really want more people to be able to watch it. (I&#039;m not exactly feeling guilty because I am undercutting their potential earnings in Indonesia...! :)) But I am also thinking about Linux distributions, compilations of Creative Commons music, or even static Wikipedia versions (I&#039;ve been working on a Rubyscript that let&#039;s you access a Wikipedia HTML dump file directly on localhost, without unzipping the file. Because of limitations of 7zip, which I&#039;m hoping to overcome, it&#039;s still very slow - so slow that trying the English version is out of the question. But for small languages like Indonesian (60MB 7zipped), it&#039;s still quite usable).</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">I could ramble on, but I&#039;ll stop here. Anyway, enjoy your stuff, and I&#039;m looking forward to reading more of your stories, and listening to your podcasts in the future.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">Thanks Stian---PS: I am just opening my laptop to add this before I go to sleep, I think the potential for distributing useful legal stuff on DVDs etc is very high, but it sometimes seems that a lot of the people doing cool stuff just expect always-on connectivity, whereas here in Indonesia, even when you have internet connection, it&#039;s very slow and expensive (even at the main office of a major international NGO, downloading a few gigabytes is unthinkable). Putting Wikipedia on a DVD is one thing, and it was inspired by my own desire to have it accessible when I&#039;m home at night, and want to look something up.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">But in my recent endeavours with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, I&#039;ve also discovered how useless it is to program without the internet! Even though I don&#039;t need the net for the actual programming, but all the documentation - every time I need a new library, download a new snippet to look at the source code, check out a documentation forum. Now imagine if we could fill a 4GB DVD with programming info - even on a zipped random access file format if necessary (but one that didn&#039;t require a reboot) - not only every single gem on Ruby gems, and every single library or application on Rubyforge, but also all the different Ruby on Rail screencasts, a functional dump of several huge Ruby discussion forums, the archives of 10 of the most prominent Ruby bloggers for the last two years, all the free PDF books out there, etc etc. By collecting all this information (which is legal and free to download) and giving it out on a CD or DVD for almost nothing (but enough to cover costs), you could probably do more to jumpstart cool young innovative programmers than anything. They&#039;re sitting at home, with their Pentium I&#039;s, without internet connectivity, and without the money to go university. But I never formally studied an hour of programming in my life either...</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">This of course also extends to non-computer stuff, like putting Gutenberg books, Librivox podcasts (the combination of Gutenberg books and Librivox podcasts of the same title is awesome for learning English - my girlfriend in China used to listen as she read along all the time, and I do this with Chinese), ... sky&#039;s the limit. Did I mention the MIT CourseWork stuff? Throw it in! Of course, language is a barrier, but many people have functional English, Ruby code can be read by anyone (although I think good textbooks for Ruby are still really needed in Indonesian), Wikipedia is in Indonesian, and there might be other great resources in Indonesian out there as well. Or this could partly function as an incentive for people to create more Creative Commons documentation in Indonesian, translating etc.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">This isn&#039;t meant as a concrete proposal or anything, I just suddenly felt like sharing it. But I&#039;m definitively adding it to my list of ideas I&#039;m going to look into implementing, and perhaps it&#039;s something you can keep in mind as you travel around and meet interesting energetic people. I&#039;d love your thoughts.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">Stian</span></blockquote>Lot&#039;s of exciting ideas running through my head. I did a lot of work on an offline Wikipedia reader, and after a lot of false starts and problems, I came up with something that worked reasonably well. It was based on the static HTML dump generated by Wikipedia, and you can see the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/zipdoc.swf"">screencast</a> or <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/03/07/git-gitoriousorg-and-zip-doc-offline-wikipedia/"">download the code</a>. However, partly because it turned out to be <a href=""http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/ruby-talk/3479286"">so difficult</a> to make a good cross-platform installer for the script, and partly because there seemed to be other alternatives emerging, I basically gave it up. Right now I have all of English Wikipedia on my iPod Touch through the <a href=""http://collison.ie/wikipedia-iphone/"">Encyclopedia app</a>, but it costs 10$ per language, so I can only afford the English one - not the Swedish, Italian, Chines, etc, as I would have liked. I still find it amazing how little enthusiasm there is for a good open source offline Wikipedia reader (for all platforms), given how much of a difference this could make in less connected countries (all my friends in Indonesia and India are excited about the idea, when I tell them about it!)As for my idea about offline access to Ruby, I talked with a lot of Indonesian Ruby activists about this, and they were quite enthusiastic. It even got included into the <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:HMklceXXICMJ:dev.blankonlinux.or.id/wiki/Pemaket/Komponen/BlankOnWikipedia-id+http://dev.blankonlinux.or.id/wiki/Pemaket/Komponen/BlankOnWikipedia-id&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;gl=ca&amp;strip=1"">""ideas for future features""</a> for BlankOn Linux, an Indonesian distribution. (It also garnered <a href=""http://readlist.com/lists/ruby-lang.org/ruby-talk/12/62369.html"">some discussion</a> on the international Ruby mailing list).I don&#039;t know if anything came out of it, however.Moving along. In 2007, I attended iCommons in Dubrovnik, and had a chance to listen to Lawrence Lessig, Joi Ito, Yochai Benkler, and Cory. I even ran into him briefly on the last day, and said hello. Then I finished my BA, and the following summer, I went to China where I spent time with the <a href=""http://www.ruralchina.org/"">Rural China Education Foundation</a> visiting two rural primary schools, and writing <a href=""http://eprints.rclis.org/archive/00013684/"">a report</a> about their fledgling community libraries (I was invited to do this, because of my research on community libraries in Indonesia for my <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/09/20/mencerdaskan-bangsa-an-inquiry-into-the-phenomenon-of-taman-bacaan-in-indonesia/"">BA thesis</a>). In one of the villages, we slept in a new ""compound"" built for the local village administration &ndash; one morning, I woke up by a man entering the room, and sitting down at the PA system next to my bed, to broadcast a message through all the loudspeakers in the village that villagers had to remove the wheat they were drying on the main road within noon, or face fines.<a href=""http://craphound.com/littlebrother""><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" title=""Cover of Little Brother"" src=""http://craphound.com/littlebrother/cover-small.jpg"" alt="""" width=""192"" height=""289"" /></a>Sitting in the tiny school library, I downloaded <a href=""http://craphound.com/littlebrother"">Little Brother</a>, and lay in bed reading it on my MacBook until 3AM in the morning. This book is perhaps the one that got the most mainstream attention, it even got translated <a href=""http://www.veslebrorserdeg.com/"">into Norwegian</a>. Since I&#039;ve always been interested in language learning, and creating parallel texts, I got the idea that maybe all the different translations of Little Brother could be used to create a website for learning languages, and I sent my third e-mail to Cory:<blockquote><span style=""color: #333399;"">Oct 4, 2009 at 10:49 AM: <strong>Little Brother in many languages - language learning</strong></span><span style=""color: #333399;"">Hi Cory,</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">I&#039;ve read all of your books, and love them. I even sent two copies of Little Brother to schools in Latin America, which was a brilliant way of supporting you and your publisher. I&#039;m excited that Little Brother is getting official translations in many different languages (including Norwegian, my native language - I live in Toronto, but it was fun seeing the Norwegian twitterati getting excited about listening to you speak in Oslo).</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">I definitively think you should link all these different language versions on the Little Brother website (I couldn&#039;t see it anywhere). But to take this further... I speak a bunch of languages, and am very interested in language learning. One thing I&#039;ve found hugely useful when studying Chinese and Russian for example, is parallel texts. Ie, books where you have English (or another known language) on the left pages and the exact same text translated into Russian (or Chinese) on the right hand sides... This enables you to read much more interesting literature than your textbook, and you always have the translation available to check words, see how it would be formulated in another language etc.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">The problem is that it&#039;s extremely hard to come across such books. In Russia, I found a book called ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"", and read the whole thing (slowly, my Russian is poor), learning lot&#039;s of verbs for swooping, diving and batting wings... It was such a great experience, that I really wanted to find more. I even had a Russian friend help me call the publisher, but we were unsuccessful in hunting down more titles.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">In China, this sort of thing is fairly common, however it&#039;s applied to books that are out of copyright (Gone with the wind is the classic), because then Chinese publishers don&#039;t have to ask anyone&#039;s permission. Needless to say, such books are neither great for foreigners trying to learn Chinese, nor for Chinese trying to learn English (their target audience).</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">So in addition to the selection of these books being very limited (usually old, out-of-copyright books), the language pairs are also very limited - usually English to something. A friend of me and I experimented with making an interface where paragraphs in different translations were connected, so that you could choose which languages you wanted to read in parallell. As an example, I put in the text of a Doll&#039;s house (an old Norwegian play that has been translated to most languages - not the most exciting text granted, but good for an experiment). I put the text up in Norwegian, Russian, Esperanto, and Chinese, and made a very rudimentary and ugly web interface at http://reganmian.net/4lang/ ... There you can choose yourself which texts are used, so that you can get a parallel text in Russian and Chinese, or Esperanto and Russian...</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">So I guess you can guess where I&#039;m going... Doing something like this with Little Brother would be awesome! It&#039;s a much more interesting and engaging read to most people, and since there are already a bunch of translations out there, hopefully most of them using open licenses, this could be an incredible resource.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">Anyway, just wanted to throw that out there.</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">Thanks for writing great stuff (and doing important activism)!</span><span style=""color: #333399;"">Stian</span></blockquote><a href=""http://craphound.com/makers""><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://craphound.com/images/makerscombinedsmall.jpg"" alt=""Cover of Makers"" width=""192"" height=""297"" /></a>He wrote back and said that most of them hadn&#039;t been published yet, and anyway it was hard to get foreign publishers to agree to license the translations under open licenses. I still think this is a great idea, try out <a href=""http://reganmian.net/4lang"">4Lang</a> for one example (obviously you&#039;d want a much slicker interface) - it&#039;s A Doll&#039;s Home in Norwegian, Russian, Chinese and Esperanto. You can at any time switch which language is displayed on the left, and on the right, without loosing your place. The interface is in Norwegian, but you should be able to figure it out.Back to Toronto, I began my MA at OISE, and I even got an iPod. I remember reading <a href=""http://www.infinitematrix.net/stories/shorts/after-the-siege.html"">After the siege</a>. I finished reading it while walking down the street to the subway station, and when I had read the last line, I had to stop in the middle of the side walk and stand for a while. It was such a tragic story. I was at a very boring conference, and checking my Twitter-feed when I  saw that <a href=""http://craphound.com/makers"">Makers</a> had come out, I downloaded it straight away to Stanza, and was reading the whole way home. The book was incredible, I devoured it on my iPod.<a href=""http://craphound.com/ftw""><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://craphound.com/images/ftw_both_smalll.jpg"" alt=""Frontpage of For the win"" width=""192"" height=""295"" /></a>And today, I just downloaded his newest book <a href=""http://craphound.com/ftw"">For the win</a>, and began reading it over lunch (on my iPod again). An amazing story, and it&#039;s hard to put down, because you want to know what will happen to General Robotwallah in Dharavi, the Jewish-American who took a Chinese name and learned Mandarin to play with a Chinese group, and is right now on the run from his father, Matthew in Shenzhen... I look forward to <a href=""http://craphound.com/ftw/donate/"">donating</a> two copies of this book to libraries that need them (brilliant idea).When I began writing this post, I was actually going to talk about a kind of fiction that I think Doctorow exemplifies, and so I began talking about when I first read Cory&#039;s novel. As I began sifting through old e-mails to figure out exactly where I was, and what I wrote to him, I thought it might be fun to just turn this into a ""around the world with Cory&#039;s writings"" blog post. I&#039;ll write that other post later.I look forward to many more excellent books, and I am excited to see in which strange places I will be reading them, and on what futuristic devices!Stian<em>Photo of Cory by Joi Ito, CC BY.</em>","Fred => I&#039;m not that well informed, but I have noticed that Doctorow has frequently announced CC-licensed translations of his works on BoingBoing over time. You paraphrase Doctorow as saying &quot;hard to get foreign publishers to agree to license the translations under open licenses&quot; but if you use fan-based translations, wouldn&#039;t that be able to work around the publisher restrictions?  I admire your effort to enable parallel translations for language learning (I try and spruce up my Spanish by watching DVDs in English with Spanish subtitles and then again in Spanish with English subtitles, but the results are ...spotty... at best).  I do believe if you pursue these parallel-language CC-copyrighted translations of Doctorow&#039;s (and others) works, you could be onto something. Please don&#039;t let go of the idea. . T Morgan => I really enjoyed this post. I found it  to be a fascinating window into the convergence of your interests--language, developing countries, and open education--grounded in the real world experiences you&#039;ve had.  Sometimes the conversations about open education seem to be so conceptual, but the journey of you accessing Cory&#039;s books in sometimes technologically challenged settings is a good reminder of both how things are and how far we&#039;ve come. . "Youtube lovefest,"media,movies,open access,personal,travel,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/05/15/youtube-lovefest/,"<p>This weekend, I have three <a href=""http://couchsurfing.org"">couchsurfers</a> from Argentina staying with me, and I&#8217;ve been practicing my Spanish a lot. It&#8217;s quite rusty, but it&#8217;s fun, and we have had some great conversations. This evening, my roommate joined us, and all five of us were sitting around the table <em>platicando</em>. We talked about Toronto, and all the different ethnic neighbourhoods they had walked past today.

I showed them the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA1NoOOoaNw"">crazy Indian dance video</a> &#8220;subtitled&#8221; into English, because I was curious whether it was also a hit in Argentina.

After watching that, we watched the amazing performance of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us-TVg40ExM"">Stand By Me</a> by street musicians around the world. It&#8217;s an incredible video, performers with such wonderful personalities, and the audio mixing brings it all together in an amazing fashion.

I of course had to show them the <a href=""http://xkcd.com/442/"">XKCD comic</a> too, although I guess it&#8217;s funnier if you&#8217;ve been following XCKD.

So the way we have cultural identity, the way we have language and science and research and reasoning in our society generally is the same mechanism as the way we have knowledge individually or personally.</blockquote>isomorphism brain and community. way of knowing, way of connecting.<strong>learning is <em>not</em> social</strong><em>(different from Siemens) &mdash; social knowledge is different from personal knowledge</em><blockquote>Let&rsquo;s think about this &lsquo;social learning&rsquo;. Think about where the models of knowledge and learning are coming from. Well, we have externally based definitions or community-based definitions. Learning objectives will be defined by the community. What counts as a body of knowledge will be defined by the community. The processes are externally-based. The processes of learning are going to be defined by the community. They&rsquo;re all &lsquo;activities&rsquo;, &lsquo;conversations&rsquo;, &lsquo;interactions&rsquo;, &lsquo;communications&rsquo;. Everything&rsquo;s happening external to the person. We have external systems. We define learning in terms of classes. Even in terms of networks, groups, collaborations. All kinds of things that are happening outside the individual person. And, of course, evaluation is by somebody external to you, an examiner or something like that.It&rsquo;s as though the entire process of learning happens in the society, in the community, and nothing happens in your head. And that just seems wrong to me. Because throughout this talk I&rsquo;ve been careful to distinguish between the knowledge in our head, that is formed by connections of neurons, and the knowledge in society, that is formed by connections of people. And the learning that happens in our head does not consist of connections between people. The connections between people is the learning society or a community as a whole does&hellip;Personal knowledge is not social knowledge. It does not consist of social artifacts. It is not constructed the way we construct a sentence. It is not built the way we build a house. It is not organized the way we organize a society. It is grown the way we grow a muscle.</blockquote><strong>metaphore</strong>: external object, network is like bar-bell to exercise. i don&rsquo;t want to become it, but use it to train muscle<strong>testing</strong>: not by asking facts, but by seeing if they can do the task - flight simulator, medical internships. can they &ldquo;fake it&rdquo; successfully<blockquote>Learning a discipline, like geography, or psychology, or any of these things, is a total state. It&rsquo;s a transformation of the self from somebody who was not a geographer to somebody who is a geographer. It&rsquo;s not a collection of individual bits of knowledge, it&rsquo;s a process of becoming something.Learning to become a geographer (or a philosopher, or whatever) occurs not by presenting people with a set of facts but by immersing themselves in the discipline.It&rsquo;s expressed functionally, rather than cognitively. &ldquo;Can you act as a geographer in a network of geographers?You see how the community recognizes whether or not a person is a teacher, whether or not a person is a geographer. It&rsquo;s like seeing that pattern, that complex pattern of associated behaviours, actions, reactions, inclinations and all of the rest.</blockquote><strong>Two modes of connectivist course:</strong><ul><li>creation of environment, open! based on idea of interaction</li><li>in this environment, people do their own thing</li></ul><strong>collaboration vs cooperation</strong><blockquote>Cooperation is an exchange of mutual value between autonomous individuals, rather than collaboration, where the two individuals subsume themselves under a single common goal.But collaboration, working together, does not define community. Community is based on each of us following our own way.</blockquote><strong>PLE as exercise machine</strong><blockquote>So, the way to think of a personal learning environment, in this context, is as an exercise machine, a way to immerse yourself in a community and work with the community, to get yourself into the community and practising with the community.</blockquote><strong>Teacher is not guide on the side</strong><blockquote>It&rsquo;s not like constructivism where the instructor is the &lsquo;guide by the side&rsquo;. None of that. It doesn&rsquo;t work unless the instructors take part too, because if you think about how community works, in a community, like a community of geographers, the alpha geographers are in there slugging it out</blockquote>Stian","The Virtual University of Pakistan has 6,000 hours of video lectures on Youtube","Education,languages,open-education,p2pU,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/05/21/the-virtual-university-of-pakistan-has-6000-hours-of-video-lectures-on-youtube/,"I find distance universities very fascinating, and have learnt much from my time visiting <a href=""http://en.crtvu.edu.cn/"">the Open University of China</a> and <a href=""http://www.ignou.ac.in/"">Indira Gandhi National Open University</a> (IGNOU) in India. Distance universities have been in the forefront of researching alternative ways of delivering instruction and enabling learning, with radio and television, online classes etc. They are also uniquely poised to open up their materials, because their courses have been designed for distance/online learning from the outset. The <a href=""http://open.ac.uk"">Open University of the UK</a>, the international pioneer of open universities, has been very innovative with its <a href=""http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/"">OpenLearn project</a>.<img src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/vu_illustration_2.png"" alt="""" align=""left"" />I was extremely excited to find the amount of material published in India by both the Indian Institutes of Technology and <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/12/05/worlds-largest-university-opens-almost-all-its-materials/"">IGNOU</a>. IGNOU both uploaded a very large amount of materials to a DSpace repository called <a href=""http://www.egyankosh.ac.in/"">eGyanKosh</a>, and also released thousands of hours of video on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=egyankoshIGNOU&amp;view=subscriptions"">their YouTube channel</a>. Being able to watch videos about rural planning, Hindi literature, economics, how to be a radio DJ, and many more topics &mdash; from an Indian point of view &mdash; is a very exciting opportunity.This morning I had a wonderful conversation with <a href=""http://acreelman.blogspot.com/"">Alastair Creelman</a>, and he mentioned that the Virtual University of Pakistan (VU) had also put thousands of hours of video on YouTube. I immediately went to check, and found <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/vu"">their channel</a> with 5992 videos! (I wonder if there will be a cake served when they reach 6000?)According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_University_of_Pakistan"">Wikipedia</a>, the VU was founded in 2002, and is &ldquo;the first distance learning university in Pakistan based entirely on modern information and communication technologies.&rdquo; In that sense, it differs from IGNOU, which was established in 1985 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGNOU"">WP</a>), and was initially based mainly on correspondence (although they also used satellite TV actively).<img src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/vu_illustration.png"" alt="""" align=""left"" />What was a positive surprise to me, when I began looking at some of the videos, is that they seem to all be in <img src=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu"" alt="""" /><a href=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu"">Urdu</a>. Although Urdu is the national language of Pakistan, many of the universities teach largely in English (similar to the situation in India). The fact that these courses are in Urdu will obviously limit the utility of these courses to the international audience, but radically increase their value to the local population. (And let&rsquo;s face it, it&rsquo;s not like the English-speaking population is particularly underserved, globally speaking).It&rsquo;s very exciting to me, because I actually studied Hindi for a year (Hindi and Urdu are very similar) and spent three months in India. I am very interested in improving my Hindi, and also in learning Urdu. In the lectures I watched, I could mostly follow the dialogue, because the professors spoke very slowly (sometimes painfully so), and frequently mixed in English words, or used slides in English.The one problem with the YouTube channel is that unlike the IGNOU account, which uses individual accounts for each faculty (which are all subscribed to b the main account), and playlists for individual courses, the VU account lumps every video into one big pool, and names them with cryptic codes like PSY032-Lecture34. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to browse around, if you don&rsquo;t know what you are looking for.Luckily, they actually store the full title of the course in the description, but this does not come up unless you click on a video. I wanted to see if I could do something about this &mdash; mainly to scratch my own itch, and I found that there was <a href=""http://rubyforge.org/projects/youtube-g/"">a great Ruby library</a> for accessing YouTube metadata programmatically. Using this, you can retrieve all the metadata for every video uploaded by a given user (or in a given category, with a different keyword, etc) using just a few lines of code. I downloaded all the metadata, used the descriptions as course titles, and sorted the filenames alphabetically, and generated an <a href=""http://reganmian.net/vu"">index page</a>.This page makes it much easier to see all courses on offer, find a sorted list of lectures, etc. Now I can really begin to explore! It&rsquo;s not perfect, some of the lectures seem to be missing, and there is a course called &ldquo;Click to add description&hellip;&rdquo;, but overall this is very useful, in just about an hour and a half of hacking, having not even played with the YouTube API previously.Here&rsquo;s the code that I ended up with &mdash; this downloads all the metadata, and spits out the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/vu"">HTML file</a> that I now host.<pre class=""brush:ruby"">require &#039;rubygems&#039;require &#039;youtube_g&#039;client = YouTubeG::Client.newallvids = Array.newcount = 1# get metadata for all videosbegin while true videos = client.videos_by(:user =&gt; &#039;vu&#039;, :page =&gt; count) allvids = allvids + videos.videos count = videos.next_page $stderr &lt;&lt; count break unless count endrescue Exception=&gt;eend# sort videos into courses based on descriptionskeywords = Hash.newcourses = Hash.newallvids.each do |vid| unless courses[vid.description] courses[vid.description] = Array.new keywords[vid.description] = vid.keywords end courses[vid.description] &lt;&lt; vidend# start generating the indexputs ""&lt;h1&gt;Course titles&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;""courses.sort.each do |element| puts ""&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\##{element[0]}&gt;#{element[0]}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;""endputs ""&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;""puts ""&lt;h1&gt;Individual courses&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;""courses.each_pair do |desc,vids| uniq_ary=[] puts ""&lt;a name=#{desc}&gt;"" puts ""&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;#{desc}&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;i&gt;#{keywords[desc].join("", "")}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;"" vids.sort! {|a,b| a.title.downcase &lt;=&gt; b.title.downcase} vids.each do |vid| next if uniq_ary.index(vid.title) uniq_ary &lt;&lt; vid.title puts ""&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=#{vid.player_url}&gt;#{vid.title}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"" end uniq_ary = [] puts ""&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;""endputs ""&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;""</pre>Here&#039;s a <strong>small</strong> sample of the courses available:<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/vu/#SOC401"">SOC401  Cultural Anthropology</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/vu/#PSY512"">PSY512 Gender Issues in Psychology</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/vu/#PSC201"">PSC201  International Relations</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/vu/#PAK301"">PAK301  Pakistan Studies</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/vu/#MKT624"">MKT624  Brand Management</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/vu/#MGT501"">MGT501 Human Resource Management</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/vu/#MCM516"">MCM516 TV News Reporting &amp; Production</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/vu/#ISL201"">ISL201  Islamic Studies</a> (seems to be mainly in English)</li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/vu/#CS704"">CS704 Advance Computer Architecture</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/vu/#CS201"">CS201 Introduction to Programming</a></li></ul>So go check it out!Stian","Closing down Virtual University of Pakistan index | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] came across the Virtual University of Pakistan&#8217;s YouTube collection in May 2010, and was amazed at the almost 6,000 videos in Urdu, but frustrated that it was so [...].

The first few are all English (with Wikipedia as number four, after Facebook, Yahoo and Live). The first Chinese website is Baidu, at number 8, immediately followed by QQ (a Chinese chat client). The third country to appear is in spot 25, with the Japanese version of Yahoo. If you go through the top 50, there are 32 English websites, 15 Chinese and 3 Japanese. If you continue down the next 50 posts, there are more English and Chinese sites, a few Japanese and Korean, and one or two Brazilian and Russian entries.Indeed, you get the sense that the two super-languages of the World Wide Web are English and Chinese, without any competition. And this makes sense. I was talking to a friend today about demographics, and how India is gaining on China (Wikipedia currently gives China as 1,34 billion and India as 1,18 billion). I asked him what the next country was: the US, with 309 million! Quite a big gap! And of course, although technology growth in India is impressive, none of the Indian languages have much of a presence on the Internet at all.It&#039;s also important to keep in mind that this list measures top web sites, this isn&#039;t necessarily a good proxy for how much content is available in that language. Some of the sites listed are actually Web 2.0 sites that host content in many languages (I counted Twitter as an ""English"" webpage, but of course, people tweet in hundreds of languages. The same for Blogger, and even Facebook, etc). Instead of using Blogger, everyone could host material on their own domain (like I do with reganmian.net), which would result in no site from that country being listed on the Top 1000 List.This is also the reason why Spanish, which according to Wikipedia is the first language of 330-400 million people, has no site among the top 50: It&#039;s scattered over so many countries. Although it&#039;s (mostly) the same language, people still use the newspapers and blog engines of their own countries. There is no surprise that all the secondary languages I mentioned above: Japanese, Russian, Portuguese, Korean &ndash; are all the national languages of very large countries. If Brazil had been split into lot&#039;s of small South-American countries, with their own individual politics and celebrities, etc, we might not find any Portuguese site on the top list.This list is important, because many top lists made by Western companies systematically under-represent content not in English (for example <a href=""http://technorati.com/blogs/top100"">Technorati&#039;s list of top 25 blogs</a>, which are somehow all based in the US). These give North Americans the idea that most of the web speaks English, and that there is no point in learning another language.I hope that the multilingual Internet will continue to grow. And these statistics might be meaningless in the future - we might all be chatting in English on a Chinese social networking site! (Remember, they have more Internet users than the US today, but only 1/4 of Chinese are online... Lot&#039;s of space to grow!)Stian","Paul Roberts => @Robert: Maybe because not all people in China are completely sticking with the rules implemented their government? After all, they do have their very own computer wizards and hackers as well.. Crafty Cockney => Makes sense seeing as the chinese make up a 1/4 of the world&#039;s population, I am surprised that they don&#039;t take up even more of the the top 1000.. Daniel Hansen => Robert,It&#039;s been 9 months since this post, so I&#039;d venture a guess that even more Chinese sites have cracked the top 50. What do you think?.

Both offer a possible model for online social learning, but they are very different.

I had this post as a long opened tab in my browser, and only today I managed to find some time to read/see it.    I wanted to comment on a few things:  I agree with you that we don&#039;t have enough (and easy) tools available as to create an experience alike to that of KF.  Then again, the user base of KF is way smaller than that of the wide network.  So the question remains if it&#039;s possible (and even if it makes sense) to create such tools.  Last year I started an experiment in Colombia with open courses, and I ended up creating some mash-ups using Yahoo Pipes, which actually make a little easier the tracking of blog posts and comments.  I talked about that earlier this year: <a href=""http://bit.ly/bjzj0W"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/bjzj0W</a>  I&#039;ve been experimenting with the creation of conversation graphs, and now I&#039;m trying to create them automatically from the content available in the student&#039;s blogs.  I do think that can be a very useful tracking tool for both teachers and students.  I&#039;ve offered three open courses so far (""Tiny Open Online Courses"", to be precise) in my country, and I have run exactly into some of the barriers that you mention in your presentation (that 80%).  The interesting thing (I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s the best word) is that I&#039;ve seen that low confidence in their learning skills in the teachers participating in the courses.  This means that these kind of courses, at least in my own environment, need to have more structure than that found in CCK*, for example.  I think we need ""transition experiences"" in order to &#039;reboot&#039; the perception of students (in my case, students who are teachers themselves)  about their own learning.    Clearly, this transition has to do with tools (use the tools they are familiar with, and avoid at the beginning new websites that create new points of attention) and methodology (give progressive control over the learning experience), among other things.  At the end, the goal would be that learners have the skills to learn on their own, using the tools they find relevant.  I expect to present some of the lessons I&#039;ve learned so far in OpenEd in November, but I wanted to chime in and let you know about the things we&#039;re doing in Colombia.  Like you said, we need to know at least who else is working in this stuff.  Kudos on the presentation.  Lots of good questions to think about! .

""How to sync slides with audio/video, a few alternatives","academia/research,open access,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/06/08/how-to-sync-slides-with-audiovideo-a-few-alternatives/,"I really enjoy giving presentations and talks. They are a great way for me to think through my ideas, and systematize them, and I can trace some of my ideas now through a series of talk as they were gradually developed (with help from the audience). I try to be an interesting and engaging speaker (although I can always improve), and I usually spend quite a lot of time thinking through what I want to say, designing the slides, etc.Ever since I gave my first public talk at Indian Institute of Public Administration, I&#039;ve recorded my talks. Usually just using Audacity on my MacBook, with the built in microphone. Sometimes the talks have also been video-recorded, or there are even fancy systems that try to capture the slides and video together (although these systems are often fickle, and can fail completely). I began putting my slides on <a href=""http://slideshare.net"">SlideShare</a> early on, and have really enjoyed the exposure that website has given me. (<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang"">All my presentations on SlideShare</a>).SlideShare offers one very neat feature called SlideCasting. You can upload or link to an MP3 of the talk, and use a syncing tool to have slides automatically progress at the right time during your talk. In that way, someone visiting the site can simply press play, and listen to the talk, with the slides advancing at the right time. Or they can jump straight to a certain slide, and hear what I said about that slide. It&#039;s a great concept, and most of my presentations use this feature. I try to not overload my slides with text, so if you just see them without hearing what I said, the presentation looses much of its value.There are some issues with the SlideCasting feature however. It takes a lot of time to edit a one hour presentation, with maybe 150 slides. It&#039;s also very difficult to put slides close together, so if you rapidly progress through a set of slides (less than 5 seconds on each), it becomes difficult. I&#039;ve also had some issues where I lost all the timings, or the timings came out of sync.I wish SlideShare let me download a text file containing all the timings for a presentation I uploaded. Or import a file in the same format. This would have several benefits. Firstly, I would feel much safer that I can get my data out (I spend a lot of time creating timings, but if SlideShare ever goes under, or I want to move to another hosting site, I loose the timings. If I have the file, there is no guarantee that the other site will accept them, but it&#039;s at least a possibility). It&#039;s also a backup in case the timings disappear. And finally, it opens for creating tools that would for example record all my timings when I give my presentation, so that I could directly import these and save a lot of time.I was just preparing my latest presentation, when I ran into a lot of problems. First, it turned out that the MP3 hadn&#039;t uploaded completely, it ended five minutes before it should. I only realized this after I had created timings for the whole file. After e-mailing support, they told me there was no way of preserving the timings, if I reuploaded the file! So I lost all that work. Then I did it all again, but somehow when I view it, the timings seem to all be out of sync.So being quite fed up, I decided to investigate some other options. <a href=""http://www.omnisio.com/"">Omnisio</a> looked promising, but it has been bought by Google to be integrated with YouTube, and does not allow new sign-ups (but we might see an interesting addition to YouTube once Google has finished ""digesting"" them). Finally, I decided to turn it into a video. I had a video of my entire talk, so I positioned that player on my screen, and the PDF of my presentation slides in a small Preview window right next to the video. I then used <a href=""http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm"">ScreenFlow</a> to record the screen, and the system audio. I simply played the entire video, and manually advanced the slides at the appropriate time.This process has some advantages. It&#039;s actually faster than creating the timings with SlideShare&#039;s tool - it only takes the amount of time it takes to watch the entire presentation. It&#039;s also much easier to have very rapid slide advancement, and it also preserves transitions (which SlideShare doesn&#039;t), although I rarely use those.After recording the whole thing (I had to do it in two sections, and splice together, because I got a warning message about two little space left on the HD in the middle), I cropped it in ScreenFlow to only display the two boxes (video and slides), and exported it to a QuickTime file. This took quite a bit (and don&#039;t try to turn on multi-pass, it will take all night). I uploaded the finished file to Vimeo, and voil. (<a href=""http://vimeo.com/12407128"">See finished presentation on Vimeo</a>).Although the editing was a bit faster, the post-editing, rendering, and uploading to Vimeo took longer. It&#039;s also far from as elegant, since people cannot easily download the slides, copy and paste from slides, click on links in slides, or search on the content (SlideShare exposes the content as text, to make it Googleable). So still not ideal, but it was a fun experiment that worked fairly well. (It&#039;s surprising how often screencasting comes in handy for grabbing a piece of video that&#039;s streaming in a weird format, I also used it to grab some of the pieces I used in my <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/houshuang#p/a/u/2/eRbWXKnxB2c"">Open Education around the world medley</a>).Stian","Warren => I am getting ready to launch a web app that provides some cool media management capabilities in the cloud (Amazon Web Services).

Since these two questions have come up frequently in other fora, I decided to post my response on my blog as well.</strong></em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>First about the word university</em></span>: University does not come from ""universe"", it actually comes from ""society"", see this <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=university"">etymology</a>:<blockquote>c.1300, ""institution of higher learning,"" also ""body of persons constituting a university,"" from Anglo-Fr. universit, O.Fr. universitei (13c.), from M.L. universitatem (nom. universitas), in L.L. ""corporation, society,"" from L., ""the whole, aggregate,"" from universus ""whole, entire"" (see universe). In the academic sense, a shortening of universitas magistrorum et scholarium ""community of masters and scholars;"" superseded studium as the word for this.</blockquote>(I remember learning about this in my class on the history of higher education as well &ndash; it would actually make for a great P2PU course; examining different models for higher education, from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academies_%28Shuyuan%29"">shuyuan</a> in ancient China, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxila"">Taxila</a> in India and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizamiyya"">nizamiyyaa</a> in old Persia, through to Bologna and Paris universities, the German and French models, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University#Early_years"">the first modern research university in the US,</a> etc).In that sense, I believe we are absolutely a university. Indeed, there are also many historical models of the university, for example in Bologna the students hired and paid the teachers. See this snippet from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_university"">Wikipedia</a>:<blockquote>Universities were generally structured along three types, depending on who paid the teachers. The first type was in Bologna, where students hired and paid for the teachers. The second type was in Paris, where teachers were paid by the church. Oxford and Cambridge were predominantly supported by the crown and the state, a fact which helped them survive the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538 and the subsequent removal of all the principal Catholic institutions in England. These structural differences created other characteristics. At the Bologna university the students ran everything -- a fact that often put teachers under great pressure and disadvantage. In Paris, teachers ran the school; thus Paris became the premiere spot for teachers from all over Europe. Also, in Paris the main subject matter was theology, so control of the qualifications awarded was in the hands of an external authority - the Chancellor of the diocese. In Bologna, where students chose more secular studies, the main subject was law.</blockquote><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>Then about how ""structured"" we should be, and which model we should follow:</em></span>This is a debate we&#039;ve had from the very beginning, whether we should be a ""free-for-all"" platform, letting people start whatever courses they wanted, or whether we should be a quality-controlled platform where courses adhered to specific requirements, and followed certain templates. Initially, most of the founders had a pretty clear vision for a platform built on quality courses, and were not inspired by the idea of another ""free-for-all"" site. However, it&#039;s very crucial here to note that P2PU does not claim to represent the entire sphere of open education, nor do we want to &ndash; we want there to be a vibrant ecology of open educational resources, and open education projects, using lot&#039;s of different approaches, governing models, funding models (for-profits can also play an important part, like <a href=""http://edufire.com/"">EduFire</a>), pedagogical models, software platforms, etc.So rather than trying to cover all the possibilities, we would like to do something where there is a gap, something that we believe a lot of people are looking for, and something which we can do well. To my mind, there are many alternatives if you are looking for a free-for-all platform. You could start with <a href=""http://wikiversity.org"">Wikiversity</a>, for example. Then you have <a href=""http://unclasses.org/"">unclasses</a>, and countless other platforms for matching teachers and students. Or you could just start something on your blog, write something on twitter with a hashtag, and see if anybody are interested. There is some great innovation going on here, and we would love to collaborate with all these other projects.But P2PU isn&#039;t Wikiversity, it isn&#039;t the <a href=""http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/connectivism/?p=53"">Massive Open Online Courses</a> that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Siemens"">Siemens</a>, <a href=""http://www.downes.ca/"">Downes</a>, and <a href=""http://davecormier.com/edblog/whos-dave/"">Cormier</a> (amongst others) have been running, it isn&#039;t the for pay video-based courses at EduFire, ... It fills its own niche. One which I think is very valuable. Personally most of my learning is of the ""networked"" kind. I tweet, I blog, I find resources, I connect with people. But if I want to read up on the Russian revolution, and would like to do that with a co-hort of people that I can discuss with, if I want a reading list that makes sense, and is only linked to openly available resources - there aren&#039;t currently any other organizations out there (that I know of) that are likely to offer that as a free online course, other than P2PU. (There are also important strengths of small structures courses, compared to never-ending networked interaction, I discuss some of my thoughts on this in <a href=""http://vimeo.com/12407128"">a presentation</a>.)And I think that having such a specific model (although we are very open to experimentation and improvement) is a huge benefit when we go out and talk to people, whether it&#039;s giving general talks, or approaching other organizations for discussions on collaboration. So yes, our vision is fairly specific, and it contains the value ""quality"". Because when I go to a lot of these platforms, I am often impressed by their vision and their ideas, but then I begin clicking around in the course catalogue, and it&#039;s very hit-and-miss. Lot&#039;s of courses that might never start, others where the course might run out in the sand after a class or two. Whereas if we at P2PU say we will offer 13 courses at a given date, people should know that they are all offered by people who are serious about running the classes, the curricula are all solid, etc. (Of course, some courses end up better than others, and we are working on that!).Finally though, I do agree that it would be great to gradually crowd-source the way we achieve these results, because obviously, if we want 100 or 500 courses per semester, we are not going to be able to have the core team approve them manually. We&#039;ve talked about different options, having community members ""vouch"" for a course, having a course automatically get offered if a certain number sign up, etc. I am sure we will see more discussion and experimentation with that. But I for one think that our goal, and our model, is still the right one for P2PU, as one small (but hopefully important!) player in the open ed landscape.Stian","How P2PU Fits into Open Education  => [...] 3, 2010 &middot; Leave a Comment  Stian Haklev has a new post on how P2PU fits into open education.

If this were a traditional course, I would not be able to commit to a specific schedule of readings, contributions etc. However, with a connectivist course, you take what you need, and give what you can (or feel like), and popping in and out of the course is not frowned upon. I did sign up for the EdFutures course, and although I was quite unable to follow all the discussions, I still got some very interesting insights (and made one important new contact) from the experience, so it was absolutely worth it. I have also signed up for this course, and look forward to the discussions that will happen.Stian",New Peer2Peer University Courses!,"academia/research,Education,open-education,p2pU,plenk2010,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/08/30/new-peer2peer-university-courses/,"There is so much exciting going on at <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">P2PU</a>, that if I hadn&#039;t been moving tomorrow, and if my MA thesis was not due in a week, I could have written many long posts.

In addition to bringing me into contact with the people and ideas that would eventually create Peer2Peer University (which in these days is launching it&#039;s third cycle, with more than 30 courses, and lot&#039;s of excited course participants and organizers), it was also the beginning of something else. During David Wiley&#039;s course, I read an MIT evaluation report that talked about how MIT OpenCourseWare had been translated into Chinese, and was used actively in Chinese classrooms.This raised all kinds of questions for me, about appropriateness, cultural difference or change, pedagogical approaches, etc, and I decided to make this the focus of my application to the program in comparative higher education (actually the program is in higher education, but I also entered the collaborative program in comparative education) at Ontario Institute for Studies in Education. I got accepted, and was extremely lucky to be able to work with <a href=""http://bellsouthpwp.net/h/a/hayhoe/"">Dr. Ruth Hayhoe</a>, a leading expert on higher education in China, and an incredibly inspiring academic.I began my studies in September 2008, but already in April 2008, I had the opportunity to attend an international meeting on Open Educational Resources in China, where I made many important initial contacts, both in the international OER movement, and in the Chinese research environment. I then began trying to unravel what was actually happening with these MIT courses, who were using them and how, etc. However, it was very difficult to find concrete examples of courses taught with MIT materials, and I had to abandon this line of inquiry. However, in the process I learnt about something called ""China Quality OpenCourseWare"" &ndash; indigenously produced open courses from Chinese universities. I changed the focus of my thesis to look at this project, how had MIT inspired the Chinese, how had the Chinese changed the North-American idea to better fit their own context, and what could this tell us about the large-scale changes that Chinese higher education was undergoing at the moment?This is what I have been working on for the past two years. It&#039;s been an incredibly interesting, and at times very frustrating journey. Almost nothing of what I believed at the outset, turned out to be the case, and I had to update my research questions many times. I was lucky enough to get Dr. Jim Slotta on my committee as a second reader, and he helped me think through the way we conceptualize Open Educational Resources. I spent about 7 months in total in China, and developed wonderful contacts and friendships with Chinese professors and graduate students, who were incredibly generous with their time and insights. I also met the frustrations of doing formal interviews according to a North American research ethics approach, in a culture where that is poorly understood.<strong>Sharing the thesis</strong>Anyway, the thesis is completed, and has been formally approved. Since November 2009, all University of Toronto students are required to submit their theses to the University of Toronto institutional repository <a href=""https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/"">T-Space</a>, where they will be available to the world. This is a wonderful improvement on the old system, and I whole-heartedly support it. However, my thesis will not appear until after my convocation (in a few months), and will be limited to one officially formatted PDF (I hate reading double-spaced PDFs on my screen, and they don&#039;t play nice with Stanza). I get no statistics from who downloads it, nor any opportunity to interact with the readers.So I am going to experiment with other ways of distributing my thesis, because I would very much like for it to be read. There are two aspects to that. The first is the availability of the actual file, where from, and in which formats. When I had finished my <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/09/20/mencerdaskan-bangsa-an-inquiry-into-the-phenomenon-of-taman-bacaan-in-indonesia/"">undergraduate thesis</a> about community libraries in Indonesia, I made sure to distribute it widely, and others have also helped me distribute it, so that it is currently available from for example <a href=""https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/10319"">T-Space</a>, <a href=""http://eprints.rclis.org/14659/"">Eprints in Library and Information Science</a>, <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=qKicTROMHX4C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=stian+haklev&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IJeOTPanFdGgnge00PDoCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=stian%20haklev&amp;f=false"">Google Books</a>, <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/10904329/Mencerdaskan-Bangsa-an-inquiry-into-the-phenomenon-of-Taman-Bacaan-in-Indonesia"">Scribd</a>, and somehow there is even<a href=""http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4495338""> a physical copy</a> on the shelves of the National Library of Australia (no idea how it ended up there!).The other aspect of distribution is making the contents accessible to people. My first thesis was translated into Indonesian, this is something I early <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/03/07/a-fair-trade-logo-for-academic-research/"">committed to doing</a>, and still is very important. Many of the people who assisted me in China do not speak English fluently, and even those who do, might not be comfortable reading a 100 page academic thesis in English (I speak Chinese fluently, but if you give me a book to read, it&#039;s a month&#039;s project). I very much want to get the current thesis translated as well, but it might take a few months before I am able to arrange it.What I didn&#039;t do with the first thesis, was to offer it in any other file formats (especially editable file formats). I also didn&#039;t do much to popularize the contents, other than writing a short note for a newsletter, and breaking it into two journal articles. With the current thesis, I plan to experiment with going further. Firstly, I am making both the original thesis, and an edited version which contains most of the same information in half the number of pages available, in a number of file formats.Download links:<table><tbody><tr><td>Edition</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Complete canonical version (101 pages)</td><td><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">PDF</a></td><td><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.doc"">DOC</a></td><td><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.odt"">ODT</a><a></a></td><td><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.rtf"">RTF</a></td></tr><tr><td>2-column edition (44 pages)</td><td><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Top-Level-Courses-2col.pdf"">PDF</a></td><td><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Top-Level-Courses-2col.doc"">DOC</a></td><td><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Top-Level-Courses-2col.odt"">ODT</a></td><td><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Top-Level-Courses-2col.rtf"">RTF</a></td></tr></tbody></table>I am also planning to publish a range of extra material. Some of this will be background material from the research, for example almost my entire collection of notes and raw research data (I still need to go through to make sure it does not contain any confidential material), as well as the full text of all the interviews I conducted. I will write a number of blog posts, highlighting various aspects of the thesis, possibly accompanied with audiovisual material, such as interviews conducted with experts in different fields, screencasts, etc. And just as last time, I will experiment with distributing the thesis widely, especially as an ebook (ePub version is coming very soon).I hope you will take the time to read the thesis, and I would love to have your comments! All information that will be published about the thesis, will be accessible from the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/the-chinese-national-top-level-courses-project"">central page</a>, and all blog posts will be in the category <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/category/ma-thesis"">MA thesis</a>, which also has its own <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/category/ma-thesis/feed"">RSS feed</a>.I welcome all ideas, feedback, criticism, comments and questions.

This received much media attention, and gradually a number of other institutions joined in by publishing their own courses. In 2005, the OpenCourseWare Consortium was formed, and it became independent in 2007. The consortium members from 24 different countries use similar software and organizing principles for their materials. If you look at a course in Japan, or in Saudi Arabia, you are likely to find the same elements: a course outline, a reading list, lecture slides and in some cases lecture recordings, and sometimes sample exams, or samples of student work.</blockquote><blockquote>If you visit Dr. Li Xuejun&rsquo;s course on pharmacology at the website of Peking University, you will find the structure very familiar. There is an introduction to the course, a list of the members of the teaching team, reading lists, lecture slides, lecture recordings and even some exam questions. This course is one of more than 12,000 open courses that have been developed by faculty from more than 700 Chinese universities, as a part of the Chinese Ministry of Education&rsquo;s National Top Level Courses Project, which started in 2003. Despite the large scale of this project, very little is known about it outside of China. Most of the English-language sources that mention it, assume naturally that it is another OpenCourseWare project, similar to those in Korea, Japan and Taiwan, for example, with roughly the same purposes and organizational principles as in the other 39 countries implementing MIT-inspired OpenCourseWare projects. MIT reports themselves frequently mention the Chinese project as one of the positive impacts of the MIT OpenCourseWare project.</blockquote>I chose a random example of a course, to make it more specific. You can visit <a href=""http://cc.bjmu.edu.cn/Able.Acc2.Web/Template/View.aspx?action=view&amp;courseType=0&amp;courseId=26773&amp;ZZWLOOKINGFOR=G"">that specific course</a> yourself. There you will see the <a href=""http://cc.bjmu.edu.cn/Able.Acc2.Web/Template/View.aspx?courseType=0&amp;courseId=26773&amp;topMenuId=71311&amp;menuType=4&amp;action=view&amp;type=&amp;name="">the teaching team</a>, which consists of 12 professors, including two non-Chinese. An introduction to the course, including the development history, the teaching contents, the teaching methods, an other topics. The actual <a href=""http://cc.bjmu.edu.cn/Able.Acc2.Web/Template/View.aspx?courseType=0&amp;courseId=26773&amp;topMenuId=74960&amp;menuType=4&amp;action=view&amp;type=&amp;name="">course material</a> consists of a detailed introduction, PDFs from the PowerPoints shown in each class, and example three lecture recordings. There is also <a href=""http://cc.bjmu.edu.cn/Able.Acc2.Web/Template/View.aspx?courseType=0&amp;courseId=26773&amp;topMenuId=71313&amp;menuType=4&amp;action=view&amp;type=&amp;name="">a detailed evaluation of the course</a>, with several articles about medical teaching written by the course team, available for download.All in all, a very impressive course, but still very similar in organization to any MIT OCW course. Is this a case of global convergence, where educational systems in all countries gradually begin to resemble each other, or might there be something else at work? I introduce the theories of world institutionalism, roughly suggesting the former, and Steiner-Khamsi&#039;s work on policy borrowing, which suggests a more critical look at the specific circumstances and meanings of a single program in a specific country, in a specific cultural and historical context:<blockquote>There are different ways of analyzing this global spread of the OpenCourseWare concept. Meyer and Ramirez at Stanford University believe that higher education systems around the world are &ldquo;converging&rdquo;, and becoming more similar. The fact that universities in 39 countries should choose to implement the same system for sharing their courses online, would seem to be a strong case for this argument, with China making a very strong addition.However, Steiner-Khamsi and Stolpe&rsquo;s research on educational policy in Mongolia shows that the government would often adjust its terminology to match international trends and demands, thus placating donors and making it seem like Mongolia was headed towards convergence, while the actual situation on the ground was quite different. They believe that to ascertain whether something is truly a case of &ldquo;borrowing policy&rdquo;, or merely using similar words for different purposes, it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of a country&rsquo;s history, culture and institutions. Inspired by this, I decided I wanted to examine how the Chinese Top Level Courses Project was organized, and how it fit in with the larger trends in Chinese higher education.</blockquote>I finally formulate my research questions, which are very general, and mostly focus on finding out exactly what the project aims to achieve, how it is organized, and how it came to exist - but also looks at it in a comparative perspective:<blockquote>The first question I asked was &ldquo;what is this program&rdquo;. I wanted to  understand all the details around how the program was organized, how  courses are created and by whom, how the program is financed, and who  uses the resources. The program began in 2003, so I also wanted to look  at how it has changed through this time period. I then wanted to  understand how it came to be launched at exactly that time in history,  looking at the history of Chinese higher education for clues of trends  that could have led to the program being launched. Finally, I wanted to  know how different the program is from the MIT OpenCourseWare, and also  how it became known among Western audiences. To summarize:<ul><li>What are the purposes of the project, how does it operate, and how has it developed since it was launched</li><li>What were the historical circumstances that led to/informed the launch of this project</li><li>How is the program different from, or similar to, MIT OpenCourseWare</li><li>How was the international understanding of the project shaped?</li></ul></blockquote><hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",ePub version of MA thesis,"MA thesis,open access,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/09/15/epub-version-of-ma-thesis/,"I have been thinking a lot about what would be the ideal file format for for example dissertations. The dissertations category is a nice example, because the institutions have basically complete control - they can ask you to do whatever they want, to graduate, and you will do it. For example, my institutions require that on the first page of each chapter, the page number should be at the bottom, centered. At each subsequent page, it should be at the top, to the right. Not sure what user testing and reading research went into determining that this is the optimal placement of the page number, but if I want to graduate, I have to do it.Similarly I have to upload a copy of my thesis to the institutional repository, if I want to graduate. This is a good thing. However, the required file format is PDF. The double spaced PDF is a singularly poor format. First, you can&#039;t resize the text. What if you want to read it on your cellphone? What if you want to print it, without wasting hundreds of pages? (I hate reading double spaced text, when it&#039;s not for grading). What&#039;s the alternative though? The one reason I prefer PDFs over Word DOCs on my system, is that I rarely have Word running, and starting it is so slow, whereas reading a hundred page PDF in Preview is a snap.I think the ideal format would probably be some kind of a semantically marked up text, which could then generate a bunch of different outputs. However, I&#039;ve never really taken to any of the different systems I&#039;ve seen, when it comes to ease of editing, or even of creating output. In the end, I did all the writing in <a href=""http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html"">Scrivener</a>, and tweaked the formatting in MS Word, until it was sufficient. I then generated PDF, DOC and RTF files (and opened it in OpenOffice to generate an ODT file) of both the canonical version, and a much compressed two-column edition that takes less then half the pages, great for printing.I also wanted to create an ePub version for ebook readers. Since I got my iPod Touch, I&#039;ve been reading hundreds of books on it, through Stanza, the Kindle app, etc. Somehow the small screen works great, when I can quickly tap to page turn (with no delay). And I would love to see people reading my thesis on their cell phones, on their iPhones, on Kindle, on the Kobo, or anywhere else.It isn&#039;t hard to generate an ePub, but it&#039;s almost impossible to generate a perfect one. There&#039;s a bunch of different programs, and websites, but almost all work by conversion. You upload (or open) a file that is formatted according to certain standards, and the program/website tries to convert this into an ePub using some fuzzy logic. Often it works fairly well (sometimes it fails spectacularly), but there are always little warts that can be very difficult to fix. The ePub format itself is simply a ZIP file with a bunch of HTML files, and some metadata. However, because of the way the file is structured, I find it very cumbersome to manually edit files. Then there&#039;s the aspect that different readers can display texts quite differently.Either way, I have an ePub file that I am fairly happy with. I created it by creating a very paired down minimalistic HTML version of my thesis (with Word, and a lot of regexps to clean out the cruft), and then ran this through <a href=""http://calibre-ebook.com/"">Calibre</a>. I&#039;ve tested it on Stanza, and iBooks (just drag the file and drop it over iTunes), and it works great. There are two small issues - the first page is blank for some reason, and whenever I use two levels of headings just below each other, for exampleChapter 5IntroductionChapter 5 will be followed by a blank page, until you come to Introduction.

"Definition of Open Educational Resources,"academia/research,Education,MA thesis,open-education,p2pU,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/09/16/definition-of-open-educational-resources/,"Since I want to discuss the Chinese Top Level Courses Project as a form of Open Educational Resources (whether it is or not, is up for discussion), I need to introduce the term, and talk a bit about my understanding of the term.<blockquote>Open Educational Resources (OER) is a term used for any educational material that is freely available over the Internet. The term was coined at a 2002 UNESCO meeting, and after several years of development of projects and ideas, the community&rsquo;s understanding of the term was crystallized into the Cape Town Open Education Declaration in 2008 (UNESCO 2002; Cape Town 2010).</blockquote>One of the key issues when talking about Open Educational Resources is of course the licensing, and this also becomes a sticky point when discussing the Chinese project, which does not use any kind of open license. Here I trace this back through the open source movement (or free software, as Stallmann would say), and the early attempts at creating open licenses, and exploring remixing through the concept of learning objects.<blockquote>The term is commonly understood to mean that the material is also covered by an open license, usually a Creative Commons license, which specifies which additional rights users have to modify, share and reuse the material. This is related to the history of the concept, which came out of the Open Source movement, where programmers freely share the source code of their programs with each other and encourage hacking and improvement.The free software movement began with Richard Stallman, who was one of an early group of hackers at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. The fledgling computer programmers freely shared code and their modifications with each other, and when commercial companies began imposing copyright on their software, and locking down the code, Stallman reacted by drafting the GNU Public License (GPL) and founding the Free Software Foundation. The essence of the GPL is that that you have the right to use the program, distribute it to others unchanged, modify it, and distribute (or even sell) your modifications &ndash; as long as you grant these same rights to your own derivative work (Xu and Stallman 2010).Since then, the free software/open source movement has grown rapidly, with products like Linux, Firefox and Open Office.org in common use, and participation by companies and governments around the world. Partially inspired by the success, and the idealist ideas of the free software/open source movement, there have been many initiatives to extend the ethics of free/open access to information into other spheres. This has given rise to a burgeoning free culture movement, based on the Creative Commons license written by Lawrence Lessig; the open access to research movement to promote free access to scholarly publications; and an open education movement.One of the early attempts to apply these ideas to education was the idea of &ldquo;learning objects&rdquo;, discrete units of instructional material that could be reused and recombined for various purposes. This would allow a similar pooling of resources that had been seen in open source (Norman and Porter 2007). There was also experimentation with creating an appropriate open license for education and cultural works. In 1998, David Wiley announced the first open content license. This license was based on the premise that educational content should be freely developed and shared ""in a spirit similar to that of free and open software"" (Wiley 2003). Later, the Creative Commons license was developed, and is now used by almost all open education projects (Carroll 2006).</blockquote>Although there is a huge variety of Open Educational Resources, my thesis focuses mainly on MIT OpenCourseWare, and other OpenCourseWare projects, as a point of comparison with the Top Level Courses. This is both because they are structurally similar in their output, and because the Top Level Courses Project has often been understood as a form of OpenCourseWare.<blockquote>In 1999, Provost Robert Brown at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) launched a committee of faculty, students and administrators to &ldquo;consider how MIT should position itself in the use of educational technology and distance learning&rdquo; (Vest 2006, 20). After deliberating on the extant business models, and considering how MIT could make a unique contribution to the field, their recommendation to Vest was for all the material to be made freely available to the world. Thus, on April 4, 2001, Vest announced that within the next 10 years, nearly all of MIT&rsquo;s courses would be made available on the Internet, and that this new program would be known as MIT OpenCourseWare (MIT news 2001a).By 2007, MIT&rsquo;s ambitious goal had been reached, and today they have published &ldquo;core academic materials &ndash; including syllabi, lecture notes, assignments and exams &ndash; from more than 2,000 MIT courses&rdquo; (MIT OCW 2007, 2010d). This very expensive undertaking &ndash; each course cost between $10,000-$15,000 to put online &ndash; was mainly financed by the Willam and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, through a joint initial grant of $11 million (MIT news 2001b). During this period, MIT worked together with the Hewlett Foundation, which committed to long-term funding of a range of Open Educational Resources, to spread the idea of OCW to other universities, and countries (Hewlett Foundation 2005).The OpenCourseWare Consortium was formed in 2005 to promote the further spread and uptake of the OpenCourseWare idea, and to support the institutions that participate (MIT OCW 2010a; OpenCourseWare Consortium 2010f). It defines the minimum requirement for an institution to join the OpenCourseWare Consortium as a commitment to publishing ten courses online (OpenCourseWare Consortium 2010f). Although some courses include video or audio from the lectures, most courses are quite skeletal, and are not designed for distance teaching, but mainly for re-use by other educators and self-study by motivated students. This is underlined by the use of a Creative Commons open license, which allows anyone to redistribute and modify the materials, as long as they do not make a profit, and give the same reuse rights to their own derivative material (MIT OCW 2010c).It is important to recognize that there is a wide variety of Open Educational Resources available, ranging from open textbooks projects, repositories of learning objects, collections of lecture videos, online virtual laboratories and virtual tutors, to databases of public domain works and academic blogs. In this thesis, I will focus mostly on the specific OpenCourseWare model, which focuses on making available resources pertaining to full university-level courses, because the Top Level Courses Project has often been compared to OpenCourseWare, and because their final products (the open courses) are structurally very similar.</blockquote><hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Categorizing OER based on four purposes,"academia/research,Education,MA thesis,open-education,p2pU,plenk2010,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/09/17/categorizing-oer-based-on-four-purposes/,"This part of my thesis is based on a framework that I have gradually developed over the last year and a half. It began with reading Mike Caulfield&#039;s blog post <a href=""http://mikecaulfield.com/2009/01/25/openness-as-reuse-and-openness-as-transparency/"">Openness as reuse, and openness as transparency</a>, where he contrasted the purposes of MIT OpenCourseWare and CMU&#039;s <a href=""http://oli.web.cmu.edu/openlearning/"">Open Learning Initiative</a>. Interestingly, this was inspired by the same <a href=""http://www.opencontent.org/wiki/index.php?title=Intro_Open_Ed_Syllabus"">course on open education</a> by David Wiley, that inspired me to begin research Chinese OER. He introduced the notion of OER projects having different purposes, and suggested  that the main purpose of OCW was transparency, seeing what other people  had done. OLI, he suggested, was more about reuse. About half a year later, I was giving a major talk at my institution about Open Educational Resources, and in thinking through how I could give a systematic overview of the field, I came up with three purposes of OER: Direct use, reuse and transparency (<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/open-education-around-the-world"">Slides</a>, <a href=""../2009/03/12/links-from-the-talk-open-education-around-the-world/"">links</a>, <a href=""http://142.150.98.64/OISE/20090312-100421-1/rnh.htm"">video</a> and <a href=""http://www.archive.org/download/OpenEducationAroundTheWorld/Slotta.mp3"">audio</a>, this topic starts around minute 36).As I began researching the Chinese project, reading the literature, and talking with professors about the purposes of that project, I realized I had to add another purpose, which I eventually decided to call transformative production: the changes in the people who produce the materials, caused by the participation in the production and opening of the materials. While I believe this effect is to some extent inherent in all OER projects, the Chinese project was the first one where I saw this as explicitly stated, and put front and center.I also become very convinced of the value of this analytical framework, when I read a number of Chinese papers that criticized or evaluated the Chinese project, but failed to discuss what the purpose should be. Some would criticize it for not being very suited for independent learning by students, when the initial project plans had never called for material useful to that group. I believe that it is impossible to fulfill all four purposes equally well (although you could probably do two or three), and that by not making an explicit choice, you end up with a project that does nothing very well:<blockquote>There are many models for developing Open Educational Resources, and this is partly because the goals of the various projects are different. To make this clearer, I propose a typology of Open Educational Resources based on their purpose. When people develop Open Educational Resources, they make many decisions regarding format, scope, organization, licensing and so on, and these are informed by the purpose the resource is to fulfill, as well as technological and organizational limitations. After publication, the resource can be used in many other ways by different users, indeed one of the strengths of the open licenses is to enable this kind of unexpected use and reuse, however the original purpose is still a useful guide. To be clear about the purpose is not only important for the design of the project, but is also a necessity for any rigorous evaluation to take place.</blockquote>I first introduce the category of transformative production, which I added after beginning to research the Chinese project:<blockquote>By <strong>transformative production</strong>, I mean that the process of producing the resource in itself has a transformative effect upon the people involved in the production process. Just as the purpose of writing an essay in school is not to generate a large amount of finished essays, but rather in the effect on the person writing the essay, this category suggests that the purpose of the production of open resources, or the opening of existing resources, is the effect it will have on those involved. This effect is always present even unintentionally, and could be positive &ndash; where teachers put more efforts into their teaching, because they know they are being filmed &ndash;or negative &ndash; when teachers abstain from experimenting in class, because they are afraid of having their failures caught on tape. However, this category covers projects that have this transformative effect as their main goal for the production of open resources. It is different from the three that follow, which all pertain to the resources after they have been produced.</blockquote>My second category was direct use by independent learners. I realize that independent learners can learn from almost anything, no matter how poorly organized or incomplete, however we would expect something more from material that had been designed with independent learners in mind.<blockquote>By <strong>direct use</strong>, I mean that the student can visit the resource and use it to learn independently. This means that the resource would ideally contain all the material needed to learn, ie. be complete. The resource should also be developed for the web, taking advantage of the possibilities offered by interactive quizzes, simulations, games, and other mechanisms. Developing this material might be expensive, and it should be clearly targeted to a specific group. A good example in this category is the Carnegie Mellon Open Learning Initiative courses (see for example Dollar and Steif 2008).</blockquote>The Open Learning Initiative is a classical example, because it not only provides a complete resource, but it also has interactive exercises, simulations and animations that aid the learner. These resources can be immensely powerful for a large amount of students, but it&#039;s extremely expensive, and requires a number of specialized skills to achieve.<blockquote>By <strong>reuse</strong>, I mean that the material can be modified, redacted, and integrated with other material. In this case, the student does not directly access the material, but the access is mediated through an intermediary &mdash; for example a teacher, or a curriculum developer. In this case, the material needs to be openly licensed, so that the transformation is legal. Material in this category does not need to be complete, or targeted to a specific group, since it will be repurposed. The material in this category is often not organized as an entire course, but as a large collection of small modules. The material should ideally be available in file formats that are easy to modify by the user. A good example in this category is Rice University&rsquo;s Connexions project, which uses small modules, an open XML file format, obligatory open licensing, a built-in system for derivation and attribution, and a flexible system for quality review to facilitate reuse and the creative building upon other&rsquo;s work (Baraniuk 2008).</blockquote>Reuse is kind of the holy grail of the OER movement, and the main reason why we care so much about open licenses. The sad truth is that very little reuse is happening, however, and most institutions are happier producing their own branded material from scratch, than improving on somebody else&#039;s material. In Mike&#039;s original blog post, he suggested a difference between scripting languages and object oriented modules as an analogy to the difference between packaged learning objects with meta-data, and ""just give me your stuff"". He elaborated on this in his <a href=""http://mikecaulfield.com/2009/01/27/more-on-transparency-vs-reuse/"">second blog post</a>:<blockquote><em>Transparency (show your code) does promote a certain type of reuse &mdash; but it is generally I think reuse of professionals of the same caliber. And this is where the OO vs. scripting language comparison comes in useful &mdash; the idea of scripting languages is sort of a single tier &mdash; scripters reuse what they learn looking at scripters.</em><em>The whole OO idea, when expressed as a business model, was that there are different tiers of user/creators &mdash; that the way-smart people make the objects and the less smart (and less paid) people script them together, and this maximizes efficiency.</em><em>The everybody is a scripter (which I see as a sort of craft model), and the specialized production OO model (which i see as a manufacturing model) come from two really fundamentally different world views &mdash; they intersect in this small place, but at the edges they start to tug at each other.</em><em>Once again, I think we need both &mdash; the Python Library is a thing of beauty, and allows me to do crazy things with code that I could never do on my own. On the other hand, so much of what I&rsquo;ve produced of use has come from hacking at spaghetti code copied and pasted from somewhere.</em><em>I think there are analogues in open education, even in a single implementation. I might grab the best lecture on Aeration from TU Delft and drop it unedited into my curriculum. I might follow that by reviewing the reading list for that course, and pulling one or two readings I have missed into my own curriculum. But I think even is this case, they are two slightly different activities &mdash; in one instance I am essentially a consumer, and in another I&rsquo;m a co-producer.</em></blockquote>In some presentations, I have differentiated between ""light reuse"" and ""heavy reuse"". By light reuse, I mean deep-linking to a resource, putting it into another curricular context, but not changing the resource itself. This is what David Wiley did with the original Intro to open ed course, he didn&#039;t produce any of the readings himself, he linked to reports, videos and other material that already existed. He didn&#039;t modify these resources, but he put them into a new context. Light reuse is much easier to do, and does not require the object you are linking to, to have an open license (as long as it is freely available, ideally without a login).This is also what we are doing at P2PU currently, and what I have often suggested could be done with the open courses in China... If you criticize them for not being good, or complete enough, why don&#039;t you create your own curriculum. There might be 20 courses on intro to economics, why don&#039;t you go through and choose the best videos, the best PDFs, the best examples, and link them together into a new curriculum? It&#039;s completely legal, and extremely useful to others. This would be similar to the object oriented metaphore, except in this case, we are not asking for the resources to be heavily packaged meta-data labeled learning objects, it&#039;s enough that they are on the web, and are direct linkable.Heavy reuse, on the other hand, means that you transform the materials themselves. You might download them, edit them, take out chunks, put them together with other resources etc. This is much more labor-intensive, and requires that the material is licensed under an open license. The most common form of heavy reuse, is translation.<blockquote>By <strong>transparency/consultation</strong>, I mean that the material will not be used directly by learners, nor will it be &ldquo;reused&rdquo; or repurposed by intermediaries. Rather, it will be available for people who are interested in learning about how a given class is taught. This could be other teachers, who wish to get inspiration about different ways of teaching the same thing, or students who are planning to choose a major, and would like to know what a given subject entails. It could inspire other teachers, or even provide materials for a comparative curriculum study. This requires material that reflects as closely as possible what actually happens in the classroom, or material that is distributed to students in a normal situation. The OpenCourseWare projects are good examples of this category, and so are the open textbook repositories in India and Indonesia (Ghosh and Das 2006; Hariyanto 2009).</blockquote>You can read more about the textbook repositories in <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/04/06/many-great-free-textbooks-from-india/"">India</a> and <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/03/19/407-indonesian-textbooks-openly-available/"">Indonesia</a> on my blog. You could say that there is a lot of overlap in terms of the material that might be made available under reuse, and transparency/consultation. In both cases, we want as much material as possible, don&#039;t worry about whether it&#039;s useful or not. And this is why the purposes of direct use on the one hand, and reuse and transparency/consultation on the other hand, can never be served well by the same project. Mike Caulfield <a href=""http://mikecaulfield.com/2009/01/25/openness-as-reuse-and-openness-as-transparency/"">says</a>:<blockquote><em>It would be tempting to say that while separable concepts, the aims of reuse and transparency are so synergistic as to never be at odds. But this isn&rsquo;t the case. Engineering for reuse takes a certain type of investment that constitutes a drag on transparency efforts. Transparency is most effective when as much is made transparent as possible. The principle behind transparency is that you never know what bit of internal information may be valuable to outsiders. And you shouldn&rsquo;t really spend too much time worrying about it &mdash; get as much open as you can.</em></blockquote>Leigh Blackall <a href=""http://learnonline.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/reuse-dragging-transparency-and-decades-of-advancement/"">commented</a> about the difficult of achieving both of these objectives:<blockquote><em>At Otago Polytechnic we have been trying to achieve both at the same  time, and some may have noticed that I use the term &ldquo;open educational  resources and practices&rdquo; to encompass that intensive approach. There is a  sense urgency in our need to update skills, awareness and policies to a  point where we able to offer quality services in open (flexible)  education arenas. But as Mike suggests, there is observable drag in  doing both.</em></blockquote>Although both reuse and transparency/consultation benefits from more available material, they differ in some cases. It is not that important that material in the transparency/consultation category use an open license (although I personally prefer it). Perhaps the most important difference is that the material in the latter category is valuable because it reflects on something else. If I want to learn about how American professors teach, and I watch OCW videos to achieve this, I am not interested in the videos themselves, but in what they reflect (what goes on in the classroom). Thus I can learn very little about how professors at Carnegie Mellon teach classes, because the OLI material is not a reflection of what happens in face-to-face classes.In a later section, I will use these four categories to discuss how the China Top Level Courses Project, and the MIT OpenCourseWare models are similar and different.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />","How and by whom are the Chinese Top Level Courses used? | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] at evaluating the project, however they often don&#8217;t separate clearly between which of the four possible purposes of OER they are attempting to address.

From the post:  This part of my [...]. Leigh Blackall => Thanks Stian,   I think trans formative is the most important, or is the parent to all the others, rather than on the same level. To this end, I often use the word Reform in OER - I actually think it is a more accurate word than Resources, encompassing your 4 areas, and more.  While I did comment on the drag of doing all at once, I really see no other way. The critique that OER brings to education is all encompassing.   Off the top of my head, there are two recent readings that lead this thinking at the moment. <a href=""http://leighblackall.blogspot.com/2010/08/webism-internet-as-social-movement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Webism</a> and <a href=""http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/dmulearnex/~3/MNUPx8KHzV0/"" rel=""nofollow"">the call for a critique of OER</a>. . "OER from the perspectives of world institutionalism and policy borrowing,"academia/research,books,Education,MA thesis,open-education,p2pU,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/09/22/oer-from-the-perspectives-of-world-institutionalism-and-policy-borrowing/,"In addition to <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/09/16/definition-of-open-educational-resources/"">defining the concept of OER</a>, and introducing <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/09/17/categorizing-oer-based-on-four-purposes/"">a taxonomy of OER projects based on their purposes</a>, I also introduce my theoretical framework from comparative education in the literature review. I begin by describing how international the OpenCourseWare concept has become:<blockquote>At the 2008 Open CourseWare Consortium conference in Dalian, China, representatives from universities in many different countries were gathered to report on the progress, and share their experiences with opening up access to their course materials. Chinese researchers shared statistics on how large a percentage of students were aware of OpenCourseWare, Japanese professors showcased their latest OpenCourseWare semantic search tool, and Mexican researchers from the Tecnologico de Monterey showcased applications for mobile learning. The concept of OpenCourseWare had decidedly gone global.</blockquote>One way to see this, is that the world is becoming more and more similar:<blockquote>This would seem to support the idea that national education systems are converging globally. The view that there is a clear trend towards increased similarity in values and system design as the result of worldwide emerging models is held by Meyer, Boli, Thomas, and Ramirez (1997, 145), who state that<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">worldwide models define and legitimate agendas for local action, shaping the structures and policies of nation-states and other national and local actors in virtually all of the domains of rationalized social life &mdash; business, politics, education, medicine, science, even the family and religion.</p>Applied to higher education, world institutionalism predicts a growing trend towards isomorphism, rather than divergence, in higher educational systems (Meyer, Ramirez, Frank and Schofer 2006). This theory proposes that educational systems are not only converging in structure, organization and content, but also in such values of education as views of progress and social justice. The fact that 39 countries are currently members of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, and have universities that publish courses openly and share teaching materials freely, could be seen as further proof that global values and institutions are converging (OpenCourseWare Consortium 2010a).</blockquote>However, not everyone is convinced that it&#039;s so simple:<blockquote>However, this theory is not without critics. Anthropologist Anderson-Levitt (2003) criticizes convergence theories for taking global schooling models at face value, and Schriewer and Martinez (2004, 33) similarly believes that we have to look below the surface, and the terms employed, to see whether they are actually describing the same reality:<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">There is a convergence of educational reforms, but perhaps it is only at the level of brand names, that is, in the language of reform. Once a discourse is transplanted from one context to another and subsequently enacted in practice, it changes meaning.</p>They also differentiate between internationalization as a real process, and internationality as a semantic construct that can be referred to selectively, according to the &ldquo;changing problem constructions internal to a given educational system&rdquo; (Schriewer and Martinez 2004; Silova 2009). They show how policy borrowing does not happen systematically, for example following a simple centre-periphery model, but rather is structured by the needs and discourses in any relevant society. References to educational innovations in other nations are often employed as a rhetorical tool to promote change that is desirable by certain groups. To discover these processes, the multi-country statistical analysis often performed by the world institutionalist group has to be complemented by very fine-grained analyses of individual cases of educational borrowing, taking into account the local context, including culture, history, power structures and discourse.</blockquote>I first learnt about the theories around policy borrowing from <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Educational-Encounters-Global-Forces-Mongolia/dp/140396811X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1285189636&amp;sr=8-5"">a book</a> by Gita Steiner-Khamsi on education in Mongolia. This books is beautifully written, and worth reading even if I you never thought you&#039;d be interested in education in Mongolia. I first heard about it by a coincidence. My friend Espen was beginning his MA in comparative education at the university of Oslo, and since my classes had not yet begun, I hung out in his classes instead. One teacher had the class read a book review of this book, and write a summary, to practice writing. I was intrigued by the book and when I got to Toronto, I got it at the library, and enjoyed reading it. Later, I was lucky enough to attend a talk by Steiner-Khamsi at University of Toronto, and although it was intimidating being the only undergraduate in a room full of graduate students, I was probably the only one who had actually read the book before meeting her.<blockquote>In her book Educational import: local encounters with global forces in Mongolia, Steiner-Khamsi and Stolpe (2006) discuss global educational policy borrowing through the lens of Mongolia. They show how the government uses the language of modern Western innovations, but does not change its actual practices on the ground. This is similar to what Schriewer and Martinez (2004) describe as using &ldquo;Ausland als Argument&rdquo;. In many cases, the Mongolian government had to adopt the language of the donors, for example applying for funding for girl-child education, even if girls were far outperforming boys in school already. In other settings, a government will refer to external examples to lend legitimacy to their policy decisions, in some cases even &ldquo;borrowing policy&rdquo; even though the practices are already being carried out locally.

"Open Governance week 1: Acting like baboons,"academia/research,open-education,p2pU,P2PU Open Governance course,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/09/27/open-governance-week-1-acting-like-baboons/,"I signed up for my first P2PU course this term, <a href=""http://www.p2pu.org/general/open-governance"">Open Governance</a>, facilitated by Philipp Schmidt (and a host of helpers). Although I&#039;ve been deeply involved with P2PU from the beginning, this is actually the first time I am ""whole-heartedly"" taking a course (I have been following along on many though).Probably the reasons I have for taking this course, and the reasons Philipp had for starting it, are similar - we are both thinking a lot about how we can support the development of the P2PU community as we go forward. A community is a very fragile thing, and it&#039;s certainly not something you can ""build"" or ""construct"", but you can nurture it, and provide the conditions for it to grow.Personally, I have also created a bunch of different projects on the web, and wondered as I saw some projects gather a lot of users, an active committed community of people who eagerly contribute and discuss, etc. Whereas others, which initially looked just as interesting as attractive, slowly turn into grey corners of the web where nobody stops. In Salman Rushdie&#039;s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haroun_and_the_Sea_of_Stories"">Haroun and the Sea of Stories</a>, stories slowly loose their colors and die when nobody tell them anymore. Maybe the modern equivalent could be websites that grow cobwebs, because nobody visit them, or online communities that decay because there isn&#039;t a vibrant community there.In addition to initiating a project, and gathering enough interest to kick-start an initial community, the question is how to manage change, and growth. If the launch is successful, you might have a close group of people who all were there ""in the early days"", all share a certain history, a ""founding myth"", a certain in-language, etc. But as newcomers arrive, are they welcomed into the community, and made to learn and absorb the culture that prevails (while still being able to make contributions - the community should not be ossified and overly conservative), or do they overrun the community, and do old-timers feel like ""it&#039;s not the same anymore""?This question could be raised about many kinds of communities, whether it&#039;s a graduate program (I was just discussing with a fellow student today about how new doctoral students are ""initiated"" into the community), a start-up company as it grows, Wikipedia or P2PU.You also have different kinds of participants. In a doctoral program, all participants will be doctoral students (although some may be part time, etc), but in P2PU, you have course participants, and course organizers. And people who are helping out with the running of P2PU. Do people who ""just"" take P2PU courses feel like part of a broader community, or are they just ""students who come and go"", whereas the ""staff"", the people who take a deeper interest, join one of the mailing lists, get involved in developing the project, are the real ""community members&#039;? (This is made more acute, compared to the situation of a traditional university, because our courses are just six weeks long - it&#039;s different with someone who is around for a four year undergraduate degree).Here were the readings for this week:<ul><li> WNYX Radiolab, The New Normal, Part 1 <a href=""http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2009/10/02"">""New Baboon""</a><a href=""http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2009/10/02""></a></li><li> RM Sapolsky, <a href=""http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~sok/papers/s/sapolsky-foreignaffairs-2006.pdf"">A Natural History of Peace</a><a href=""http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/%7Esok/papers/s/sapolsky-foreignaffairs-2006.pdf""></a></li><li> <a href=""http://www.sharpbrains.com/blog/2008/04/05/peace-among-primates-by-robert-sapolsky/"">Short summary of Sapolsky&#039;s thesis and work</a></li></ul>In parenthesis, I really loved the <a href=""http://www.radiolab.org/"">WNYX Radiolab</a> show, and subscribed to their podcast feed, very glad to have discovered this program. Much of the readings were about the work of Sapolsky, a scientist studying baboons in Africa. To make a long (and very well told story) short, baboons are known to be very aggressive animals with high stress levels, the males constantly struggling amongst themselves. In the particular case that Sapolsky studied, the alpha-males would go to fight another tribe each morning for access to a garbage dump outside a lodge. Through contaminated meat, they got tuberculosis, and all the strongest males in the flock died.This caused a very marked behavioural change in the flock, with only the younger males, and the females left, and a very different male-female ratio, the behaviour became much more nurturing and supportive. Sapolsky wrote this off as the result of a freak accident, and decided nothing could be learnt about baboon nature by studying this tribe, so he left. A number of years later, when he returned (on his honeymoon I believe!), he was shocked. The key to understand his shock is that baboons leave their flocks when they get into their teens, and join another flock. So by now, all the males in the flock where baboons who had grown up in other flocks, with the ""traditional"" aggressive baboon behaviour as a norm. Yet, at that time (6 years later) and today (20 years later) the tribe still has this unique nurturing culture.This means that the baboons who came into the flock actually learnt, or adapted these new cultural norms - that previously had seemed ""contrary to baboon nature"". When asked how this happened, the biggest difference that Sapolsky could find was how newcomers to the community were treated. In traditional baboon society, newcomers have to struggle for weeks before anyone will take notice of them, constantly fighting with the big boys, and with no females willing to groom them. In the new flock, newcomers were welcomed as equal members much more rapidly.Of course, it is very difficult to transfer directly these lessons to human society in all its forms, but a focus on how a community welcomes new members, and initiates them into the community is very useful, both for P2PU and for other communities. The question of how to create community cohesion in an online community, where you lack a lot of the intimacy and shared experiences that you can create in meatspace, is also an interesting challenge.I don&#039;t have anything very deep to say about all this yet, but I think it was a really great and fun start to the class, warming us up to think about these various topics, and I look forward to engaging with new readings, and guest lecturers, to think more deeply about these problems.Stian","Philipp => Hey Stian: Nice to interact with you in this way. We spend so much time talking about these issues in various channels, but I appreciate the formality of this medium.  One idea for P2PU is that we might see the community evolve into different sub-groups (which happens in open source software communities as well - Greg&#039;s post on Ubuntu highlights that). Also related to Greg&#039;s post, there is however also the question of what it means to be a P2PU member (gang star?) - what are the benefits, what are the responsibilities, and how do you get recognized as one? I really like the member page on the Ubuntu wiki and think many of the things listed there make sense for p2pu gang stars ... email addresses @p2pu.org - that would be cool no? . e-prod lab => [...] http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/09/27/open-governance-week-1-acting-like-baboons/ Stian describes his experience with diverse projects on the web that promote active commitment, and also many that degenarate along time, losing their colors. A good point is the conservative stance of old-timers members. He understand the nice behaviour of the modified baboons toward the newcomers as a key factor to the prosperity of cooperative norms. A real challenge in online communities seens to be lack of intimacy and shared experiences. [...]. "Russia&#8217;s influence on Chinese higher ed &#8211; 1949-1958,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/02/russias-influence-on-chinese-higher-ed-1949-1958/,"In my thesis, I spend a lot of time discussing the history of higher education in China since the formation of the People&#039;s Republic of China in 1949 until today, especially focusing on the process of course development, and the development of course evaluation systems.<blockquote>I will show how China began implementing a very rigid and centralized curricular system in the 1950&rsquo;s, which they imported from the Soviet Union, and which lasted until the middle of the 1980&rsquo;s. In that period, control over the curriculum was loosened up, and at the same time, we see the first traces of course evaluations.I will argue that this history is crucial to understanding the factors that enabled the Top Level Courses Project to be launched in 2003. The history of government oversight over the curriculum, teaching teams and course evaluations in individual universities came together with a focus on selecting and funding excellent units, a focus on IT in education, and a desire to maintain or improve quality in the face of explosive enrolment growth.</blockquote><strong>Learning from the Soviet Union</strong><blockquote>The Soviet Union had already in the 1930&rsquo;s implemented central control over the higher education curriculum, with the Ministry of Higher Education establishing a standardized academic calendar, curriculum, course schedule and detailed course requirements for all specializations. Every lecture course was given a syllabus with highly detailed prescriptions of ingredients (Korol 1957, 209, 329). The Soviet system was also based on clear specializations that began from the first year of study.When the students from the 1919 May 4th reform movement in China were seeking foreign ideas, they looked to Japan, America and Europe, but also to Soviet pedagogy, and later the Soviet school system had a strong impact on schooling in the Communist base areas (Yang 2004). In 1945, Mao reaffirmed that China should use the Soviet Union as an example, and after the founding of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China in 1949, the Vice Minister of Education stated that to learn from the Soviet Union should be the main direction of developing a new educational system (Mao and Shen 1989, 84)The first Soviet expert groups arrived already in October that year, visiting Shanghai and Beijing, and giving talks on the Soviet system (Mao and Shen 1989, 83-86). Although the first few years were marked by a cautious approach, which rewarded existing universities that had a fairly liberal approach, and introduced a credit-system for choosing courses, this period of openness was short-lived. Before long there was a closer and closer identification with the Soviet Union, away from self-reliance and toward an all-out emulation of Soviet patterns and practices (Hayhoe 1996).For higher education, two universities would serve as &ldquo;beachheads&rdquo; for integrating Soviet expertise and experience within the Chinese national context: The People&rsquo;s University for social science, and Harbin Institute of Technology for natural sciences and technology. The People&rsquo;s University was a brand new university, created on the model of Soviet institutions, and directly overseen by senior members of the government (Mao and Shen 1989, 89). This university was a huge investment for a young country, and in 1950, it represented 20% of the national educational budget (Cheng Fangwu, cited in Mao and Shen 1989, 90).From 1950-1957, the People&rsquo;s University hosted more than 98 Soviet experts, a larger number than any other university. These experts helped train teachers, conduct research on teaching and develop pedagogical theory, teach graduate students, and develop educational material. In 1954, a large national meeting was held at the People&rsquo;s University to popularize the lessons learnt. The meeting was well attended, and because of the high status of the university, many other universities wanted to send teachers there, or to collaborate with the researchers at People&rsquo;s University (Mao and Shen 1989, 92).Different from the People&rsquo;s University, which was created from scratch, Harbin Institute of Technology was an existing university that was chosen for its position in a border-region with Russia, where most students were Russian descendants and spoke Russian (Mao and Shen 1989). Originally called Harbin Sino-Russian Technical School, it had been established in 1920 as a Russian-language institution to provide personnel for the China Eastern Railway Company. Interestingly, the school was reorganized in 1922 in a very similar effort to the great national reorganization of departments which would come in 1953 (see below).In 1935, the area where the school was located had become part of Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet-regime, and a process of Japanization changed both the structure and the language of instruction at the school (Otsuka 2001). This dual heritage of both the Russian system, and the rapidly industrializing Japanese system, made it a key institution for Russian technical experts. From 1951 to 1957, the university hosted 67 experts from 26 different Russian universities, which helped train graduate students, determine the educational plan for each specialization, and create models for undergraduate courses in technology and natural sciences (Mao and Shen 1989, 92).Very little of the teaching material from before the founding of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China was kept. Instead, detailed teaching plans were drawn up by the Soviet experts, and a large-scale program of translating Soviet material began. By October 1957, 1869 teaching publications and mimeographed sheets had been translated and compiled (Zhou Yuliang 1986, 448-449). Due to the strong centralization of the higher education system, also a lesson from the Soviet system, this material was in use at all Chinese universities. As Lewin et al. (2004, 147) put it:<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The overriding characteristic of curriculum development in China since 1949 has been central control of a nationally unified teaching syllabus. What to teach in schools (educational objectives, content selection), when and how to long to teach it (timetabling), and, to a lesser extent, how to teach and evaluate students, have all been the subject of detailed central guidelines.</p>Zhou Yuliang (1986, 459-460) mentions Zhejiang Normal University as an example of how pervasive the Soviet influence was. In 1955, the university offered 153 courses. Of these, 41 were based on texts directly translated from the Soviet Union, and the other 79 had been developed based on Soviet models.The Russian influence was not only limited to course materials, but extended to the entire organization of the higher education sector. The Russian higher education system was organized with specialized universities focusing on teaching, and with research happening mainly in research institutes, such as the Chinese Academy of Science (Hayhoe 1987). Universities were not all under the Ministry of Education, but rather were organized under, and funded by, their respective ministries. These were sometimes defined by product, as in the case of the Universities of Iron and Steel, which were administered and funded by the Ministry of Iron and Steel, and whose graduates would go on to work in the iron and steel industry (Hayhoe 1989).The reorganization of colleges and departments in China (yuanxi tiaozheng, 院系调整), which was part of the first Five Year Plan (1953-1957), aimed at reorganizing the whole Chinese higher education sector according to this pattern (Hayhoe 1996). At the institutional level, the organization of curriculum by colleges, each with several departments, which had been common in the pre-1949 universities, was now cancelled. Universities had departments directly under their central administration, and specializations within departments now became the main organizing unit for the curriculum, with the credit system terminated, and each specialization following a uniform curriculum, and being given an annual quota of students.The result of this was a centralized and rigid system, with very little freedom for students to choose their courses, and for teaching faculty or institutions to design programs of study, or determine the contents of individual courses. The rigid organization of departments and specializations meant that there was very little scope for collaboration, or even contact, across the disciplines.</blockquote><hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Chinese higher ed during Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/03/chinese-higher-ed-during-great-leap-forward-and-cultural-revolution/,"<strong>From the Great Leap Forward to 1977</strong>The Great Leap Forward began in 1958, and aimed to make China much more self-reliant and able to rapidly catch up to the developed world. During this period, there was wide-spread experimentation in the Chinese education sector, with more focus on grassroots education and indigenous knowledge (for example schools of traditional Chinese medicine). There was also more focus on applied research &ndash; universities were encouraged to set up small factories, and linkages between higher education institutions and the research organizations were strengthened (Hayhoe 1996).In this period, there was a strong movement to develop more local curricular content, with students contributing to writing new textbooks, and introducing regional differences. This happened together with a strong growth in non-formal and adult education, with evening classes at regular universities, and spare-time universities attached to state-owned enterprises and rural communes. The result was a mushrooming in the number of institutions of higher education (from 229 to 1289), and the number of students enrolled &ndash;although questions were raised about the quality of education provided through these non-formal institutions (Hayhoe 1996).In 1963, however, there was a retrenchment, following the losses that had been experienced through over-ambitious efforts at expansion in the Great Leap Forward, and the famine that had happened. The Ministry of Education issued the &ldquo;Decision on Unifying Management in the Higher Education System&rdquo;, which stated that the central ministry had the full responsibility for preparing teaching plans (jiaoyu jihua, 教育计划) for each specialization, teaching outlines (jiaoyu dagang, 教育大纲) for each course, and textbooks that were nationally standardized (Hayhoe 1987). The preparation of these materials was led by the Ministry, in consultation with academic subject committees, whose members were often professors at the most prestigious universities. Each specialization had several teaching and research groups (jiaoyanzu, 教研组), responsible for researching methods to transmit knowledge as efficiently as possible (Hayhoe 1989).The teaching plans for each specialization contained four points: the purpose of formation in that specialization, the organization of time, the structuring of all the required courses and the arrangement of the teaching environment. The teaching outlines for each course included a statement of aims and requirements for the course, list of important content areas in appropriate order, list of basic reference texts, and teaching guidelines (Hayhoe 1989).<strong>Cultural revolution</strong>During the Cultural Revolution, there was a strong growth in the informal track of education and in basic level education. This had begun to emerge during the Great Leap Forward, and now grew strongly, as a more radical political faction took control of the government. The educational ideas of the Cultural Revolution were based around the idea of giving workers and peasants broad access to education. There was a also a phenomenal growth in secondary education, and a strong push for full integration between the educational system and all aspects of social life &ndash;the very opposite of the Soviet specialization and departmentalization that had reigned before (Hayhoe 1996).Formal universities were mostly shut down between 1967 and 1971, with students travelling throughout the country making revolution and learning from the experiences of workers and peasants (Hayhoe 1987). When they reopened, they mostly taught shorter and more general programs (Hayhoe 1989). However, the system became very politicized, for example abolishing merit-based exams in favour of recommendations based on class-background and political objectives. Age limits were eliminated, together with the merit-based entrance exams and the examination-based grading system, and the number of school years needed for graduation was reduced (Yang 2004).There was great discontent with the centralized Soviet-inspired curriculum that had prevailed, and the People&rsquo;s University, which had been one of the beachheads for Soviet influence in China, remained closed over the entire period from 1967 to 1977. Similarly, the national bureaus responsible for planning and disseminating the standard teaching plans, outlines and textbooks were abolished, and old textbooks were criticized for being too theoretical, and narrowly specialized (Hayhoe 1987). Committees of students, teachers, and worker-peasant-soldier representatives were set up to take responsibility both for administering higher education, and for creating new teaching materials that would reflect local needs. The ideal was both to give control over the knowledge that would be transmitted to teachers and students, and to ensure strong links between academic and real-life knowledge (Hayhoe 1987).<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Chinese higher ed after the Cultural Revolution: continuity and change,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/05/chinese-higher-ed-after-the-cultural-revolution-continuity-and-change/,"In discussing the reestablishment of the university system after the Cultural Revolution, Pepper (1990, 131) believes it was essentially a continuation of the pre-Cultural Revolution model from the 1960s:<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">In all other respects, the university system that was reestablished between 1977 and 1980 essentially replicated the antebellum model of the 1960s, which was essentially the same as the Sino-Soviet compromise variation that had emerged from the early 1950s pro-Soviet period. Hence, all of that system&#039;s centralized features abolished during the 1966-76 decade were restored. These included the national unified college entrance examinations, unified enrolment and job assignment plans, unified curricula, and systematized rules and regulations for everything.</p>As an example, the &ldquo;Decision on unifying management in higher education&rdquo; was affirmed by the Central Committee in 1979, and the Ministry of Education was again given the role of regulating nationally standard teaching plans, teaching outlines, and textbooks. The Ministry of Education only administered 38 higher institutions directly, but it made all major curricular decisions for the 226 institutions administered by other national ministries, and the 411 institutions administered by provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions (Hayhoe 1987).However, change was coming, and the changes to the &ldquo;The Sixty Articles&rdquo;, which had originally been proposed in the retrenchment period of the early 1960s, were harbingers of greater openness. Universities were to be centres of both teaching and research, as of the Decision on Reform promulgated in 1985, not only of teaching, and intellectuals were to be regarded as part of the working class, thus having greater freedom of action (cited in Zhou Yuliang 1986, 461). There was also a small increase in the power of university presidents, although the role of the party committee was still important (Hayhoe 1989).With the 1985 reform, the government aimed to:<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">change the management system of excessive government control of the institutions of higher education, expand decision-making in the institutions under the guidance of unified educational policies and plans of the state, strengthen the connection of the institutions of higher education with production organizations, scientific research organizations and other social establishments, and enable the institutions of higher education to take the initiative and ability to meet the needs of economic and social development. (cited in Hayhoe 1989, 40-41).</p>Universities gained much leverage in adjusting the objectives of various disciplines, formulating their own teaching plans and programs, compiling and selecting teaching materials (Hayhoe 1991). There was also a reduction in required course hours in favor of electives, more time for self-study and student initiatives. The role of the Ministry of Education was no longer to produce authoritative teaching plans and outlines, but rather to organize teaching material committees (jiaoyu ziliao hui, 教育资料会) and guide the development of material. It also acquired foreign curricular material from from a wide range of countries, not only the Soviet Union, but also Japan, Germany, France, and the United States, among others, and organized their translation and distribution (Hayhoe 1989).<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",The beginning of course evaluations in Chinese universities,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/08/the-beginning-of-course-evaluations-in-chinese-universities/,"<em>Having reviewed how modern Chinese higher education began as an import from the Soviet Union, with very centralized and rigid curricula and no local autonomy, we now come to a watershed. Universities are gradually given more power to modify the curricula, and at exactly the same time, systematic course evaluation systems are introduced. I later argue that this is a crucial precursor to the Top Level Courses Process, which is essentially a giant national course evaluation system.</em><hr />Around the same time that the universities gained more freedom over their curriculum and teaching, efforts began to measure and improve the quality of courses. The Shanghai Higher Educational Bureau began experimenting with evaluation in 1983, to raise the quality of teaching, strengthen the teaching of basic courses, and improve the training of practical ability. At all 45 institutions of higher education in Shanghai, courses on the history of the Chinese revolution, political economy, philosophy, English, Chinese, higher math and general physics were examined to catch teaching problems, and to promote the reform of teaching (Zhou Yuliang 1986, 458). In 1984, the Higher Education Bureau of Jiangsu province conducted the first peer-reviews of teaching quality in teacher&rsquo;s colleges and universities since the founding of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. The process lasted 25 days and involved 50 people, who examined a broad range of materials and questions:<ul><li>Conditions of teaching work, including teaching documents</li><li>Whether implementation and reform of teaching content met the proper requirements</li><li>Whether the questions in examinations were written scientifically and seriously</li><li>Teachers&rsquo; academic levels</li><li>Attitudes towards teaching</li><li>Teaching methods and teaching results</li><li>Students study burden</li><li>Study attitudes and the ability for self-study</li><li>Aptitude tests</li></ul>The purpose of this peer-review exercise was for institutions to learn from each other. It was purely qualitative, with no standardized measurements (Zhou Yuliang 1986, 459-460).There were a number of other experiments with teaching evaluation, using different units of analysis. Zhejiang University and East China Chemical Industrial College both implemented evaluation of departments in 1983. The next year, Beijing Normal University also implemented an evaluation of course teaching quality in their departments. In 1985, South China Normal University experimented with course evaluation throughout the whole school. A trial program for appraising the quality of teaching, based on teaching attitudes, content, methods, and results, was printed and dispatched to all departments (Zhou Yuliang 1986, 459-460).After these various experiments, the practice of evaluating courses and teaching practice in higher education gradually became formalized in 1985. In May, the &ldquo;Decision on Reform of the Educational System by the CPC Central Committee&rdquo; pointed out that ""the educational and intellectual sections and the employment units are to be organized to appraise the levels at which institutions of higher learning are run"" (State Education Commission, cited in Zhou Yuliang 1986, 461). In June, the Ministry of Education organized a meeting on the problems of evaluation in engineering education, and then in November published the &ldquo;Circular on the Implementation of a Study and Experiment on Appraisal of Higher Engineering Education&rdquo;, which contained the two appendices &ldquo;The Standard System for Appraisal of the Educational Levels at which Higher Industrial Institutions are Run&rdquo; and &ldquo;Measures to Enforce the Appraisal of the Educational Levels at Which Higher Industrial Institutions are Run&rdquo; (State Education Commission, cited in Zhou Yuliang 1986, 461).In December, the State Education Commission held another meeting, on the reform of teaching work in comprehensive universities. There, it was decided to conduct tests of teaching evaluation at Nanjing University, Fudan University, Wuhan University, East China Normal University and Beijing Normal University. In May 1986, the State Education Commission entrusted East China Normal University with convening a working conference on the evaluation of specialities and courses in higher education. At this meeting, universities proposed various programs and standard systems of evaluating the quality of teaching, based on their own experiences and pilot programs. This led to the collectively drawn up document &ldquo;Comprehensive Standard System of Appraisal for the Quality of Courses&rdquo; (Zhou Yuliang 1986, 461-462).<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Course evaluations and quality assurance in Chinese higher education,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/10/course-evaluations-and-quality-assurance-in-chinese-higher-ed/,"Since the beginning of formal course evaluations in 1985 with the appraisal of engineering education, systems of quality assurance developed rapidly. Evaluation and recognition of excellence among courses were used to foster competition and reform of curriculum and teaching approaches (HEEC 2010).One of the two universities I visited during my research, University B, is a normal university (university with teacher training as an important part of their mission). The academic affairs officer there explained to me how their course evaluation developed, since they first began evaluating courses internally in 1987. Those course evaluations looked at the quality of the teachers, the academic level of the teachers, teaching team composition, teaching content, and teaching materials. The initial courses selected for evaluation were the key obligatory courses in each specialization. After beginning experimentally in 1987, they regularized the process in 1988, and added the competition to become designated as an &ldquo;excellent course&rdquo; (youxiu kecheng, 优秀课程). The following year, they added the requirement that every single course would pass an &ldquo;approved course&rdquo; (hege kecheng, 合格课程) test.The test was quite simple, it just required a course to have an approved teacher or teachers, a syllabus, and use approved teaching materials. The academic affairs officer at University B explained that their motivation was to get rid of those courses without a syllabus, where teachers went &ldquo;all over the map&rdquo;, and to standardize educational quality. University B continued this evaluation system until 1992, when the provincial Bureau of Education began evaluating key courses, which continued for almost ten years. In 1997, the State Education Commission began to organize the National Teaching Achievements Awards, which were received by 422 teachers in the first year (MoE 2010). In 2000, the province also began evaluating and selecting excellent courses. University B had been prepared to evaluate again, but that was the one and only round of evaluations, because the system then became superseded by the National Top Level Courses Project (Mr. B0).In the meantime, the State Education Commission had issued &ldquo;Regulations for the Award for Instructional Achievement&rdquo; in 1994, as a result of studying the power of teaching awards to motivate teachers and administrators (Wang Xiufang 2003). In the late 1990s, the Commission began randomly selecting a few universities each year for teaching audits. These were conducted at all levels of universities, and included examining teacher performance, portfolios, textbooks, student assignments, teaching records and examination papers. Some provinces and municipalities, like Shanghai, also began organizing their own centralized course evaluation projects. In addition, it became common for universities to let senior and retired university faculty attend classes taught by junior faculty to provide feedback and critique (Vidovich, Rui and Currie 2007).In addition to a narrow focus on teaching and courses, systems for evaluation and quality assurance of entire institutions also appeared. In 1990, the State Education Commission released the &ldquo;Draft Regulation of Higher Education Institution Evaluation&rdquo;, which was the first regulation of higher education evaluation (HEEC 2010). This was followed by the &ldquo;University Evaluation Standards Project&rdquo;, which released standards for the evaluation of six different categories of institutions: comprehensive universities, industrial colleges, agricultural and forestry colleges, medical colleges, finance and economics colleges, and foreign languages colleges.All new undergraduate degree-granting colleges were required to undergo this evaluation, and by the end of 2002, 192 institutions had gone through the process. In 2003, the &ldquo;Action Plan of Education Innovation 2003-2007&rdquo; made it clear that all higher education institutions must undergo quality evaluation every five years. The work is carried out by the provinces, and supervised by the new Higher Educational Evaluation Centre of the Ministry of Education, which was founded in 2004. This centre maintains a pool of over 1,000 experts, who performs the evaluations, and provides them with regular training (HEEC 2010).<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Norwegian interview about Chinese Top Level Courses and OER production,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,open-education,p2pU,personal,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/10/norwegian-interview-about-chinese-top-level-courses-and-oer-production/,"I met Martin Aasbrenn, a Norwegian doctor and medical educator, through Twitter.

Project 211, which was mentioned in this plan, was launched through the project &ldquo;Reform Plan of Teaching Contents and Curriculum of Higher Education Facing the 21st Century&rdquo; in 2004, which ratified the establishment of 211 big projects and nearly a thousand sub-projects with tens of thousands teachers participating. The plan covered areas of teaching such as teaching ideology, teaching contents, curriculum structure and teaching methodology, and was supported by an advisory group of domestic experts from all disciplines (MoE 2010).According to Futao Huang (2005), the main objectives were to intensively finance Peking University and Tsinghua University to enable them to become world-class universities, to enhance the quality of 25 other leading universities, and to improve the quality of over 300 key disciplines in different institutions. During the first phase, from 1996 to 2002, about 18.3 billion RMB was allocated from the central government, and by September 2004, 99 universities had been selected and given special support by the government (Huang 2005).This was followed by an &ldquo;Action Plan for Education Promotion for the 21st Century&rdquo; in 1998, which mentioned a number of large projects, such as the &ldquo;Project for Creating Talented People with a High Level&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Plan for Creating the Most Excellent Universities and Disciplines in the World&rdquo;, &ldquo;Modern Long-Distance Education&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;Project for Industrializing the High Technology in the Universities&rdquo; (Huang 2005). The Action Plan also launched project 985, which again began by funding Peking University and Tsinghua University intensively. In July 1999, the Ministry of Education added seven more institutions, and by 2010, it had funded 43 universities.1998 also saw the beginning of a large scale increase in enrolment in Chinese higher education, with the Ministry of Education releasing the &ldquo;Action Plan to Vitalize Education Facing the Twenty-First Century&rdquo;. This plan set targets for educational reform and development until 2010, and stipulated a large increase in enrolment. In 1999, Chinese higher education institutions enrolled 4.5 million students, and by 2010, this number has increased to almost 30 million (Pretorius and Xue 2003; Shen 2010). In terms of coverage, the higher education system has gone from covering 3.5% of the cohort in 1991 to 22% in 2002, while the average institutional size quadrupled from 2,381 to 8,715 students (Li and Lin 2008). Since 2003, China has also had the world&rsquo;s largest national higher education system (UNESCO 2003).The final large trend during the 1990s was university mergers. The higher education system had been patterned after the Soviet Union, as has been shown in the early part of this chapter, and thus it had a large number of very specialized universities. Many of these were now compelled to join together to form large comprehensive universities (Mao, Du and Liu 2009).<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Inception of the Chinese Top Level Courses Project,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,open-education,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/12/inception-of-the-chinese-top-level-courses-project/,"After discussing the historical background for Chinese higher education since 1949, I now come to how the actual Top Level Courses Project was created in 2003. I will explain the factors that I believe led to the creation, and will also describe the project as it exists today, and as it has developed during the last 7 years, in detail. This will be based on both literature review, and a number of interviews with academics and administrators involved with the production of Top Level Courses. The groundwork for the project was laid in 2001, with a report:<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">In 2001, the Ministry of Education released a document called &ldquo;Some ideas about strengthening undergraduate teaching and improving pedagogy in higher education&rdquo; (MoE 2001). This document laid out the case for an improved focus on teaching, including an increase in financial resources, and encouraging more full professors to teach undergraduate courses. Teaching quality was to be made an important criterion for promotions, young academics were to receive special training in teaching and pedagogy, and more courses were to be taught in English, or a mix of English and Chinese. The final two recommendations are particularly relevant to the Top Level Courses Project: more educational technology was to be applied in education, and the document also called for the establishment and improvement of teaching quality monitoring and assurance systems.</p>Then, in 2003, the specific project was launched:<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">In April 2003, the National Top Level Courses Project was formally launched by the Ministry of Education (MoE 2003). It set forth a plan to use the development, selection and publication of Top Level Courses to carry out the goals of the 2001 policy mentioned above, to which it made explicit reference in its justification. The creation and evaluation of these model courses would act as a catalyst and promote the improvement of all courses, raising the general importance of pedagogy and teaching within universities. The policy called for all universities to design a comprehensive plan for how the project would be implemented, to make sure that it raised the quality the teaching at the entire university.</p>So why did this happen?<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The head of the academic affairs office at University B (B0) explained that enrolment in Chinese higher education had begun expanding rapidly from the year 1999, transitioning from elite education to mass higher education. This expansion happened too fast, and there was not sufficient equipment or teachers available. According to Mr. B0, this led to society doubting the quality of instruction. The Top Level Courses Project was designed as a way to make universities and individual professors care more about the quality of instruction.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Professor B3 puts the project into a historical perspective, and shows how it was the natural consequence of a trajectory that had begun with the Ministry of Education first focusing on evaluating the best national universities, and increasing their funding. The second step had been to identify national key disciplines, so that a given university would have educational technology as its key discipline, another economics. These were also peer-reviewed, and implied increased funding, and a responsibility to lead the development of that particular field. However, a discipline is still very broad, so finally the Ministry of Education decided to evaluate individual courses.</p><hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Course selection criteria for the Chinese Top Level Courses,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,open-education,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/13/course-selection-criteria-for-the-chinese-top-level-courses/,"The initial policy defined a quality course as being a model course with &ldquo;first-class teaching teams, first-class teaching content, first-class teaching methods, first-class course materials, first class teaching and first-class teaching management&rdquo; (MoE 2003). These &ldquo;six first-classes&rdquo; are mentioned in almost all literature on the project, and were also repeated by most of my interview participants.The specific aspects listed in the first policy paper specified that the courses should be taught by top teachers, who have long experience and influence in their fields. This was partially to address the desire, also expressed in the 2001 policy paper, to attract full professors at top universities into spending time teaching core undergraduate courses. The content of the course should be up-to-date and reflect the cutting edge of the academic field. The course should be taught with advanced and innovative teaching methods.Teaching materials should either be award-winning nationally approved materials, materials developed by the teachers themselves, or material from abroad. More experiential and practical learning was encouraged, for example experiments and internships. Finally, the university was to set up effective incentive and evaluation mechanisms for rewarding participation in the project, and effectively selecting and improving appropriate courses.In 2004, a more detailed policy note appeared, which provided further information about the requirements for courses. Both regular undergraduate courses, and courses from vocational schools, that had already been taught for at least three years, were accepted. The head of the teaching team should be a full professor. To evaluate that person&rsquo;s teaching capability, a minimum of one 50 minute video recording had to be made available on the website, but universities were encouraged to put up recordings of all lectures. In addition, the syllabus, lesson plans, exercises, laboratory guides, and reference material also had to be made available online (MoE 2004).In the previous chapter, a number of course evaluation systems that preceded the Top Level Courses project were discussed. One of these, at Tsinghua University, actually gave its name to the Top Level Courses project (Han Xibin and Ju Feng, personal communication). According to Mr. B0, most of the categories listed, such as teaching teams, teaching contents, teaching methods, teaching principles, and the academic level of teachers, were similar to earlier evaluation methods. The most important innovation was the focus on educational technology, ie. developing internet resources and then sharing them openly.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Development of the selection criteria for China&#8217;s Top Level Courses Project,"academia/research,china,MA thesis,open-education,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/14/development-of-the-selection-criteria-for-chinas-top-level-courses-project/,"As the Ministry of Education has gained experience, there have been continuous changes from year to year of the evaluation criteria for Top Level Courses. These range from minor variations in the rating rubrics used, to more large-scale changes in priorities. The actual rubric used to evaluate courses has five comprehensive indicators: teaching teams, teaching content, teaching conditions, teaching methods and practice, and instructional outcome. These five are subdivided into 15 secondary indicators (one was removed in 2008) as listed by Wang Peng (2008):<ul><li>teaching team, including responsible person and main lecturer</li><li>the composition and quality of teaching team</li><li>educational reform and educational research</li><li>the course content</li><li>the organization and planning of the course content</li><li>the practical components (removed in 2008)</li><li>teaching materials and other resources</li><li>conditions for practical components</li><li>online teaching environment</li><li>instructional design</li><li>instructional approach</li><li>instructional practice</li><li>instructional outcomes &ndash; evaluation by peers, by university supervisor,</li><li>student evaluations</li><li>evaluation of recorded materials</li></ul>When it comes to large scale changes in focus, Professor B3 commented that initially the online resources were not that important, because the Internet was not very developed at the time that the Top Level Courses Project started. As the web grew in importance and sophistication this changed, and in 2004 and 2005, requirements about the functionality and design of the course website increased.Likewise, Mr. B0 stated that the provinces and the Ministry of Education have focused increasingly on the sharing of resources and providing a service to others. This is a marked change from the first few years, when the application process was the main focus. Initially there were not many courses, and attracting a number of high-quality courses was the focus. Later, as the number of courses increased, it became important to offer better access to these resources, which led to the creation of the Jingpinke.com portal (see the later section on this).Wang Peng (2008) who studied how the evaluation criteria had changed from 2003-2008, also identified a number of trends. He reaffirmed the added focus on instructional design, pedagogy, use of technology, impact and sharing, and the building of local teams. When evaluating the changes, it is often more interesting to look at the explanations given for the different criteria, than the weight assigned. For example, the explanation for the criteria &ldquo;evaluation of recorded materials&rdquo; changed from specifying &ldquo;dignified bearing, clear sound, full of teaching enthusiasm, lively class atmosphere, high student participation rate, and effective student-teacher interaction&rdquo; in 2003 to asking for ""influential teaching which attracts students attention, enlightens and inspires thinking, association and creativity&rdquo; in 2004 (ibid. 39).As new categories of courses were added, new rubrics also had to be developed. For example, the evaluation of online courses put more focus on course resources for self-learners, the teaching and learning process, and learning support design. Zeng, Zeng and Fan (2007) believe this to be natural, and mention high student numbers, and a focus on adult learners that need practical and vocationally oriented training as key features distinguishing distance education from teaching programs in traditional universities.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Two stages of development of the Chinese National Top Level Courses Project,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,open-education,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/24/two-stages-of-development-of-the-chinese-national-top-level-courses-project/,"The Top Level Courses Project&rsquo;s official title was &ldquo;Project for the quality of teaching and reform of teaching in institutions of higher education, work on the construction of Top Level courses&rdquo;, and was always meant to be a part of a larger project for enhancing quality and reforming teaching in higher education. In 2007, the State Council, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Finance officially launched the three year ""Project for Reform of Teaching and Improvement of Teaching Quality in Institutions of Higher Education"", usually referred to as the Quality Project (zhiliang gongcheng, 质量工程). The project launch had been preceded by more than a year of investigation, research and open meetings with stakeholders (Li Bin 2007).This project targeted 1000 universities with 10 million full-time students, and was to cost approximately USD $365 million. The targets were as follows: Help 3000 professors and administrators to develop peer training exchanges, select 1000 national-level teaching teams, give awards to 500 top national teachers, develop 500 experimental teaching centers, 500 individual talent development and creativity areas, and 500 high quality bilingual classes (Jingpinke 2010). In addition, the project would restructure majors, publish teaching evaluations and data on teaching and learning, promote mutual assistance between universities in Eastern China and universities in Western China, and promote self-study, learning through research, and practical learning to improve initiative and creativity among students (Wen 2007).As for the Top Level Courses Project, the first stage from 2003 to 2007 had produced 1,500 national Top Level courses, with the focus on commonly taught basic undergraduate courses. The second stage, beginning in 2007, had a target of constructing 3,000 national level Top Level courses. That year, the Ministry of Education also expanded the project to include online courses, and during the next three years of operation, evaluated 149 national level online Top Level courses. After this expansion, including online courses, and also courses from public security and military schools, the project covered a total of 700 institutions of higher education in every part of China. From 2003 to 2010, 3790 national level courses have been produced, including 2528 undergraduate courses, 1037 vocational courses and 209 online courses. In addition to the national level courses, more than 6000 provincial level courses, and a large number of university-level courses have been produced (NTCP 2010).In addition, the 2007 stage called for the creation of an organized system for sharing the course materials generated, and supporting the development of software and portals that could facilitate this sharing (Wang Xueyin 2008). This would later become the Jingpinke.com portal, which will be discussed in a separate section.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",How to be an open scholar (OA week 2010),"academia/research,libraries,open access,p2pU,plenk2010,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/24/how-to-be-an-open-scholar-oa-week-2010/,"<a href=""http://www.openaccessweek.org/""><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-24-at-4.42.18-PM.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-748"" title=""Screen shot 2010-10-24 at 4.42.18 PM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-24-at-4.42.18-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""435"" height=""324"" /></a>Open Access Week</a> is a great idea - now in its fourth year, it really enables communities to come together across the world to promote the concept of Open Access. Last year, we had a number of very successful events at University of Toronto, I gave a talk about institutional models for OER (<a href=""http://connect.oise.utoronto.ca/p98085499/"">video</a>,<a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/InnovativeProjectsInThePublishingOfOpenEducationalResources""> Mp3</a>, <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/innovative-projects-in-the-publishing-of-open-educational-resources"">slides</a>), and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Willinsky"">John Willinsky</a> (<a href=""http://mediaspace.oise.utoronto.ca:8888/tinkerne/Willinsky/Willinsky_Caption.mov"">video</a>) gave a very moving talk about how he got Stanford University&#039;s School of Education to <a href=""https://mx2.arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/4450.html"">embrace Open Access</a>.This year, there was another <a href=""http://discover.library.utoronto.ca/open-access-week/open-access-events"">great slate of events</a>, and I was involved in a number of them. One of the talks I gave was about ""What it means to be an open scholar"". I gave three versions of this talk, a shorter one that was more focused on my own experiments, and ideas for others to try, at UT Scarborough, and a longer one, where I added a section about ""future trends in scholarly communications"", at the OISE/UT library. This final talk was video-recorded, and both <a href=""http://142.150.98.64/OISE/20101021-120919-1/rnh.htm"">the synced video+slides</a>, as well as the <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/what-it-means-to-be-an-open-scholar-and-the-future-of-scholarly-publishing"">slides themselves</a> on Slideshare, are available.This is a new talk that I have never done before, and it was a lot of fun putting it together. Much of my time as an OA advocate is spent trying to get people to deposit their works in <a href=""https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/"">T-Space</a>, our institutional repository, and explaining the basics of Open Access, including <a href=""http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/485-Please-Dont-Conflate-Green-and-Gold-OA.html"">green and gold OA</a>. I did mention this briefly in the beginning of the talk, but most of my talk was trying to push the boundaries. Because while it&#039;s important to get all of our existing journal articles out there, a huge Web 1.0 database of PDFs isn&#039;t really that exciting.So I started out with a quote from <a href=""http://www.academicevolution.com/2009/08/the-open-scholar.html"">Academic Evolution</a>, defining an ""open scholar"":<blockquote>The Open Scholar, as I&#039;m defining this person, is not simply someone  who agrees to allow free access and reuse of his or her traditional  scholarly articles and books; no, the Open Scholar is someone who makes  their intellectual projects and processes digitally visible and who  invites and encourages ongoing criticism of their work and secondary  uses of any or all parts of it--at any stage of its development.</blockquote>I started out with T-Space, and showed that people are actually getting to the articles there through some very interesting pathways, including Wikipedia articles. The problem is that there is little or no statistic exposed to the authors, so professors will never know that their article is linked from a Wikipedia article, a blog, or even an undergraduate course syllabus. I think exposing this could create some very excited self-archiving evangelists - people like to be read.I then discussed some of my own publishing experiments. The first was the translation of <a href=""http://eprints.rclis.org/14659/"">my BA thesis</a> into Indonesian, based on my <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/03/07/a-fair-trade-logo-for-academic-research/"">an early blog post</a> where I speculated about creating a ""fair trade logo"" for academic research, of which one of the requirements would be to make your research available in the language of the people you researched. I showed some interesting statistics, showing that the vast majority of people who had downloaded the thesis, had been from Indonesia.I then discussed my ongoing efforts at sharing <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">my MA research</a> on the Chinese Top Level Courses Project. I have made the thesis available in many formats, including ePub, and I&#039;m in the process of blogging the thesis right here.I used another quote by <a href=""http://www.academicevolution.com/2009/08/the-open-scholar.html"">Academic Evolution</a> to talk about sharing not only the final polished output of your research, but also the many artifacts that are generated during the research:<blockquote>The current Open Access model is provisioning for legacy genres and formats of scholarly communication. That&#039;s great for archival purposes, but this is not the next real destination for scholarly discourse. Why? Because consequential intellectual work takes place in myriad ways outside of traditional scholarly genres, that&#039;s why, and the digital realm is ready to capture, organize, value, and disseminate those other ways of generating knowledge.</blockquote>I gave as example a Wikipedia article I&#039;ve written about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCourseWare_in_Japan"">OpenCourseWare in Japan</a>. This is based on material from my thesis, but it&#039;s not the main topic of the thesis - people interested in information about this would probably not download my entire thesis, but this way they can easily find it on Wikipedia - I even had citations, which Wikipedia loves.I then talked about opening up the research process, giving a number of examples of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Notebook_Science"">Open Notebook Science</a>, and mentioning the concept of distributed <a href=""http://www.birds.cornell.edu/citscitoolkit"">citizen science projects</a>, for example the Wikiversity <a href=""http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Bloom_Clock"">Bloom Clock project</a>. As an example of somebody who has really opened up their PhD research process, I showed <a href=""http://www.cormaggio.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page"">Cormac&#039;s PhD wiki</a>, where he has put up all his research notes, including detailed notes from meetings with his supervisor. I noted that these kinds of attempts at opening up the process of research are not only useful to other people in the field, but can be a great resource for students who are curious about the scientific process.I made the case for having an online profile, for example my page listing all my <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/publications_and_presentations"">publications and presentations</a>, and also made the point that I feel that I understand much better the research trajectories and ""big ideas"" of some open scholars that I have never even met physically, compared to some of the researchers in my own institutions who I see every day (I explored this further in <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/04/19/open-scholars-and-divergence-convergence/"">this blog post</a>). I also talked about my use of <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang"">Slideshare</a> and <a href=""http://twitter.com/houshuang"">Twitter</a>.For the future of scholarly publishing (here my the formatting of my slides got mangled), I picked out a few key trends. I posited that we will need to recognize new forms of scholarship in the future, one of these could be curation, of which I think the blog <a href=""http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/"">Sociological Images</a> is a great example. I discussed the shift from journal metrics to <a href=""http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/print/55343/"">article metrics</a>, and used <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/home.action"">PLoS One</a> as an example. I mentioned experiments with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review"">open peer review</a>, the idea of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_journal"">journal disaggregation</a>, and in talking about getting away from PDFs, cited some of <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/anitawaard"">Anita De Waard</a>&#039;s work on semantic markup. Finally, I used <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog"">the Guardian datablog</a> as an example of linked data, both sharing more data in usable formats, and linking these directly to the journal articles.Putting together the presentation was a lot of fun, and I have been inspired by so many in the Open Access field. I got lot&#039;s of inspiration from my participation at <a href=""http://conferences.aepic.it/index.php/elpub/"">ElPub 2009</a> and <a href=""http://www.libereurope.eu/node/369"">OAI6</a>, as well as lots of great OA bloggers and open activists in general.Stian","Learning, collaboration &#8211; research  Academic workflow => [...] See also Stians blogpost How to be an open scholar (OA week 2010).

"Institutional perspectives on the Chinese National Top Level Courses Project,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,open-education,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/25/institutional-perspectives-on-the-chinese-national-top-level-courses-project/,"This section will provide a view of the Top Level Courses Project from the institutional perspective. Based on interviews with professors, administrators, and some published literature and reports, I will first describe some cases for how universities organize the selection of courses.<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">University-level Top Level Course selection is organized and implemented by individual universities, based on their course development plans and the courses that are traditionally highly ranked internally. From courses that have already developed good materials, have distinguishing features, and can play an inspirational role for other teachers, the university administration will choose a certain number of courses, and invest in their further development.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">University B has a long tradition for educational technology, and was one of the first universities to have a course designated as Top Level in 2003. The work on developing Top Level Courses, and the use of this process as a lever to improve the educational quality at the university, continues to have high priority.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The academic affairs office at University B is very concerned with whether courses are well enough constructed, so that they will have a high potential for winning in the provincial and national competitions. Their self-described strength is their &ldquo;pre-application process&rdquo;. All 20 departments in the university can propose courses, and these get a small amount of seed money for development. The courses that are selected for this internal process are courses that are already impressive, with many having gone through a period of more than ten years of development. However, they have to be updated, and they especially have to develop online material that reflect well on the course.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The courses are given 1-2 months for development, and after that, they create an expert committee composed of internal and external experts that begin evaluating the courses. The external experts come from other high-ranking universities in the region. This evaluation is based mainly on the available online resources, but a supervisory committee made up of very experienced and retired teachers also goes to listen in on classes, and solicit students&rsquo; evaluations of the teaching materials. The task of the academic affairs office is not to get directly involved in evaluation, but rather to coordinate the process.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The internal university committee discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each course, especially where there is a difference in opinion with the external experts, and the best courses are proposed as provincial and national courses. The teachers who have already had a course accepted as a provincial or national Top-Level Course also contribute to share their experiences of the process.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">University B has an ambitious goal for developing Top Level Courses, they want 700-800 of their 3000 courses to reach Top Level status, which would represent 30% of courses. Their short-term goal is to get 500 Top Level courses between 2012 and 2015, which should include all obligatory courses. In addition, they are spending considerable energy trying to put up recordings for every single lecture for all their 124 existing Top Level Courses, to complement the requisite representative lectures. This focus on improving existing Top Level Courses is also reflected in their annual monitoring process, where all heads of departments sit around a table, display one course at a time on a projector, and check how much of the course contents has been updated.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">When interviewing the person in charge of coordinating the development of Top Level Courses at University A, he put much less focus on the process of quality improvement. &ldquo;Here the teachers and courses are already very good, so we don&rsquo;t have to do too much work to improve them.&rdquo; Mr. A0 believes that professors from University A have strong moral values, and would work hard on improving their courses even without such competitions, but he acknowledged that internal competition between colleagues in the same department can push professors to work harder on improving courses. Similar to the case at University B, most courses entered into the Top Level Courses selection process at University A are courses that have a long history of development as excellent courses, and were not developed specifically for the Top Level Courses Project.</p>I also quote extensively from a detailed published case study concerning <a href=""http://www.lztc.edu.cn/"">Lanzhou City College</a>.<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Wang Xueyin (2008) has published a quite detailed case study from the development of Top Level Courses at Lanzhou City College, and their process has many similarities with the one at University B. After the province put out the call for Top Level Courses applications, the university began by calling a meeting with all the heads of departments, to ask them to identify top courses that had potential to become a Top Level Course. They then established a teaching committee to identify basic and specialized courses that were relevant, and brought the teachers of those courses together with personnel from the computer department to discuss how online teaching materials could be constructed. Like at University B, the school decided to provide some funding to construct the initial courses.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The main guiding philosophy was that the construction of Top Level Courses would support the improvement of quality of all the courses at the school, and ideally the courses that could have the most impact on the entire department would be selected. The university administration also underlined the point that the idea was not to simply recycle existing courses online, but rather to think through the design, and update the teaching methodology and content. When the course development was complete, the university organized an online blind peer-review of the course, and based on this, determined whether to award the university-level Top Level Course designation.</p>Thus, the universities play a key role in the selection of Top Level Courses:<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">As we have seen from these three case studies, universities play a key role in the Top Level Courses Project, selecting potential candidates and supporting their development, until they can be selected as a university-level Top Level Course. Universities also have to submit an annual report about the construction and sharing of Top Level Courses, includingupdating and keeping the resources available, students&rsquo; use and feedback, support from the school, the open sharing situation of the resource, amount of resources spent on developing the course, and how much the university is spending on supporting development economically and organizationally (Liu Zenghui 2009).</p>Promotion to higher levels<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The announcement of university-level Top Level Courses is made public, and anyone can both visit the course website, as well as provide feedback. If there are no strong objections to the course during this period, the decision will be made to suggest the course for a higher level designation (provincial level, and then national level).</p>The provincial level<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The provincial bureau of education is responsible for planning the distribution of provincial level Top Level Courses based on the provincial plan for educational development and course development. Based on this, the provincial bureau of education will ensure the completion of the provincial level project, as well as the suggestion of courses for the national level selection. The courses that enter the provincial level selection process must already have been designated as university-level Top Level courses. The province then organizes an online blind peer-review by subject specialists, based on provincial evaluation criteria, which may differ by province. The courses selected are made public, and awarded the provincial level designation, as well as a sum of money to support the further development of the courses.</p>The national level is the final step - it has more stringent selection criteria, and a higher reward.<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The final step is the national level Top Level Courses, organized by the national Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education is the highest level organization responsible for the organization and management of the Top Level Courses Project, organizing the selection of different types of courses (undergraduate courses, vocational courses and online courses), providing guidance around the entire process of developing and evaluating courses, and supervising the annual evaluation and selection of courses at all levels. The selection of national level courses is similar to the university-level and provincial level process, however the requirements for each indicator (course quality, course evaluation management, financial support, quality control, etc) are much stricter.</p>To conclude:<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">From the description above, we can see that the Top Level Courses are awarded different levels of designations (which to a certain extent reflect their level of maturity). The financial support arrives after the course has already been developed, which means that the university first has to use its own money to invest in course development, before the course can receive additional support when selected to higher levels. This is congruent with the original intent of the project, which was to stimulate universities to invest more in course development.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The three levels in the selection of Top Level Courses follow similar processes, and in practice, to improve the linkages between the three levels, most university-level and provincial level selections employ the same standards as the national selection (Wang Long, personal communications). This also serves to raise the quality of courses at all levels. In addition, since the entire process of development, sharing, and peer-review of courses happens through the Internet, the educational technology demands are quite high. The focus on digitization of resources, teaching and learning in online settings, communication between students and teachers, generative assessments, etc., all help promoting the integration of information technology and teaching and learning in higher education.</p><hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Introducing individual Top Level Courses case studies,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/26/introducing-individual-top-level-courses-case-studies/,"I interviewed five professors at two universities who have had their courses selected as Top Level Courses. Below, I will briefly introduce the courses, and in later posts, I will detail these professors&#039; experiences with course selection, and the impact of having been selected.<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">An interesting finding from the interviews was that most courses had been developed for a long time before they applied to, and were selected as Top Level Courses. The macro-history of course evaluations in China that was discussed in the previous chapter is here illustrated through the personal histories of these individual courses, which often had been selected as excellent university courses. Professor B1 began teaching her course in 1991, when it was a voluntary course. Later it became designated as an obligatory course. The teaching team constantly strived to improve the course, applying to have the course recognized as an approved course, and later as an excellent course. Finally, it was even designated as a class directly sponsored by the Ministry of Education (jiaoyubu zhuban ke, 教育部主办课).</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Professor B2&rsquo;s course was started by the same person who set up the department where he teaches, a professor who was very well-known within China. He proudly notes that the textbook written by this professor has been published continually for 50 years, and had a huge national impact. Since he was such a leader in the field, the course is still today marked by his specific approach to the discipline, especially his emphasis on connecting theory to practice. Professor B2 is one of the students trained by him, one of many teachers in this department who are his students, and is proud to continue his heritage through continually developing teaching teams, teaching materials and courses. This course also received the excellent course designation from the university, before they applied to be a Top Level Course.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Both Professor A2, who began teaching in 1997, and Professor A1 have also taught their courses for many years. Professor A1&rsquo;s course is an important obligatory course in the major, and one of the key courses at the university. During the years of teaching, a lot of emphasis has been put on developing teaching materials and course contents. Until 2007, the course was entirely lecture-based, but since 2007, they changed to include an internship where students can put their knowledge into practice.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Many of the courses had also developed web resources before the Top Level Courses Project. Professor A1&rsquo;s course did not have an external website, but he had put many course resources on a campus learning management system (open only to registered students). Professor A2&rsquo;s example is interesting &ndash;his course is also open to students from the Western province of Xinjiang, who come to the university as visiting scholars. In 2004-2005, their demand for more online resources after they had returned home provided the initial impetus to create a website, where he slowly began putting up recordings and other material, together with a discussion forum.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Professor B2 began developing a website for her course in 2001, which contained courseware, questions, descriptions of experiments and other teaching materials. Under a provincial program called the 151 Project (151 gongcheng, 151工程), she and her colleagues also developed a resource database, where they deposited a number of resources from the course. They also received requests from other universities for access to the materials, because the textbook mentioned above has been so popular and widely known.</p><hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />","Case studies of applying for the Top Level Courses designation | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] my previous post, I introduced the course case studies.

In this post, I will describe their experiences with applying for the Top Level Courses designation.</em>Both Professor B1 and Professor A2 were relatively early in applying for the Top Level Course designation. In both cases, they realized that their existing material was a very good fit for this new program. Professor A2&rsquo;s school began applying for courses in 2004, and when they asked who had courses that could fit, he volunteered, because he knew that the existing resources they had developed would be very appropriate for the Top Level Course requirements. He also believed that it would be an honor to receive the designation.Professor B1&rsquo;s story is similar, she applied for the university-level designation in 2005, and in 2008 her team applied for the national level designation. She says that they never applied for the designation excellent course because they wanted the recognition, but because they thought that through the process of applying they could provide a better course for the students. When the Top Level Courses guidelines came out, they realized that they were even more detailed and stringent than the university&rsquo;s own excellent courses, so they decided to use the application to improve their course further. They also benefitted from help from the school of online education in creating the website. Although she said that getting the designation was not very important for her herself, she does mention that universities now take Top Level Courses into consideration when assessing professors for promotion.Professor B2 also applied for the designation in 2005, but Professor A1 did not apply until 2008, five years after the Top Level Courses project had been launched. She said she knew about it the whole time, but thought that as long as others knew she had a good course, that would be sufficient, and did not consider applying for this designation. In 2008, her department began to put more focus on developing Top Level Courses, as part of a process of becoming an international first class university, and expand its influence. At that point, she decided to submit her own course for consideration. An added factor was that a new textbook, which she had developed, had won a national Top Level Courses price for teaching materials the year before, as well as the innovative adding of an internship to the course design.Both Professor A1 and Professor B1 also mentioned planning for their legacy as factors in the decision to apply for the Top Level Courses project. Professor A1 retired in 2008, and had anyway been planning to make recordings and leave behind a memory of his teaching at the university. Professor B1 explains that she will retire in a few years, and needs to find some young professors that she can train to continue the courses. Building up the course teaching team through the Top Level Courses Project can be one way to further this goal.When applying, many of the professors visited existing Top Level courses for inspiration, as well as getting support from their colleagues. Professor A1 visited other courses by people in his department, to see how they had done it, and the academic affairs office at Professor B1&rsquo;s university organized for new applicants to learn from people with very good Top Level Courses, both from their own school and from the outside. Both Professors B1 and B2 also visited other courses online, and in fact Professor B2 is involved in the evaluation process for her discipline, and had the chance to visit many campuses and learning from other professors.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Effects of being selected as Top Level Course for individual professors,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,open-education,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/28/effects-of-being-selected-as-top-level-course-for-individual-professors/,"<em>In my <a href=""../2010/10/26/introducing-individual-top-level-courses-case-studies"">previous post</a>,  I introduced the course case studies. In this post, I will describe how the professors described the impact of having their course selected as a Top Level Course.</em>When asked about what had changed after applying for the Top Level Courses designation, most of the answers from professors centered around the process of applying; while some believed that it had led to a significant improvement in quality, others believed that it had not changed very much. Professor B2 was in the first category, saying that these last years they have been continually improving the teaching materials, largely thanks to the impetus given by the Top Level Courses Project. The text book has been turned into a series of text books, and they not only got very good results in last year&rsquo;s teaching evaluation, they also got first prize in the provincial Educational Achievement competition. Much of this he ascribes to the guidance provided by the Ministry of Education, and the local academic affairs office.Professor A2 had always taught his course alone, but because one of the criteria for applying to the Top Level Courses project was the formation of a teaching team, he now shares the responsibility with four other teachers, both training young teachers to one day take over, and involving more senior professors, who would otherwise not engage in undergraduate teaching. Other than that, recording lectures has not changed his way of teaching. He recounted that a colleague had asked him whether they should find someone to &ldquo;polish&rdquo; the class, because currently professors lecturing use very informal language. He had answered that there would be no point, because the recordings should reflect reality, and they should not make the course too artificial.Professor B1&rsquo;s class had always had a teaching team, but she also felt that the project had had a large impact. The most important outcome for her was becoming more aware of the process of course construction, and the goal of course development. Earlier, she believes she did things more randomly and intuitively, without considering why she made certain choices. The process of applying has changed this, and now she is constantly improving the class in a systematic fashion, according to guidelines. She believes this has also had an effect on the development of other courses with which the course team members are involved.Professor B2&rsquo;s team had a similar experience. Earlier, they just used whatever teaching material they had, whereas now they continually explore and improve their course. The project has provided motivation for them to improve, and has also brought the teachers involved with the course closer together. They have introduced several innovations into the teaching of the course, for example allocating an entire day for experiments, and letting students set up and prepare everything themselves, rather than preparing everything in advance. This shift to more inquiry-based learning, which focuses on student initiative, is more effective at making students understand the excitement of research and conducting experiments.The existence of a large body of open resources has also changed the way Professor B2&rsquo;s team teaches in other ways, by making the team think of new ways of doing things. Simply following the textbook is no longer sufficient, since so many high quality resources are available that cover the basic material. This year, they organized a class where a number of colleagues each taught one session of their most excellent material, and it was all recorded. Professor B2 found this way of lecturing more interesting, because you can really bring in the most cutting edge research problems and theories into the classroom, rather than being confined strictly to the textbook.The only professor who did not feel that applying to the Top Level Courses Project had made a large difference, was Professor A1. Although his course has also seen many innovations and changes in the last few years, he believes that these would have happened even without the project. He says that the team was mainly focused on improving the course, but the department put a large emphasis on the Top Level Courses Project, and wanted people to apply for this honor. He laments that applying took a lot of time, which might have been spent more effectively on improving the course.In addition to the impact on teaching practices and philosophy that came out of the application process, there were also some tangible outcomes of having courses selected as Top Level Courses, but professors focused much less on this aspect. Several mentioned honor to themselves, and to the institution, as one incentive for applying. There was pride in feeling that their courses now had a national impact, and were used by professors and students elsewhere. The usage of the resources will be discussed in a separate section below.Being awarded the Top Level Course designation also comes with some funding, from the Ministry of Education, the province and the university. For example, Professor A2 received 100,000 RMB, which was mostly spent on buying cameras and building the website, but there was also a bit left over to fund excursions for his students. Professor B1 spent the money he received on hardware and software for providing the online resources<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Effects of the Top Level Courses Project for institutions,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/29/effects-of-the-top-level-courses-project-for-institutions/,"When discussing the effects of the Top Level Courses Project with academic affairs officers and members of the evaluation committee, many of their answers reflected the experiences of individual teachers. There was agreement that it had raised the quality of courses, and the awareness of pedagogy and standards. Mr. B0 said that all academic staff who teach now know the national standards for each course, and that this standardized pedagogy has improved the quality of teaching. This goes together with the generally increased focus on quality in teaching, which especially Professor C0, member of the national evaluation committee, emphasized.However, standardization does not mean a lack of innovation. Indeed according to Mr. B0, teachers that earlier taught in a very traditional fashion, with very little discussion in class, had through the process of applying to the provincial Top Level Courses Project changed their pedagogical ideas, and the design of the class.Much of this has happened through an increased emphasis on reflection and discussion. As Mr. B0 said, earlier, teachers would all go to their own classrooms, and would never listen to other people&rsquo;s classes. Now, not only do the course teams enable sharing and reflection around the course material within a small group, but having all the materials published online also enables a larger group to get involved, including the academic affairs office and the peer-review committee.Due to the process of applying for Top Level Courses, professors have also become more tech savvy, and are using more educational technology in all their courses. Lectures are recorded, so students who did not catch everything, can watch them again after class. Courses have blogs, where teachers can leave homework, and students can communicate with teachers outside of class.The issue of legacy was also raised, the idea that when old and famous professors pass away, the only thing left is their notes. By recording their lectures and their course material, the Top Level Courses Project means that people can &ldquo;attend their lectures&rdquo; even in the future.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",How and by whom are the Chinese Top Level Courses used?,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,open-education,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/30/how-and-by-whom-are-the-chinese-top-level-courses-used/,"<em>This thesis does not intend to evaluate the success of the Top Level Courses Project, which would require a much more rigorous study design. There are some Chinese studies that have looked at evaluating the project, however they often don&#039;t separate clearly between which of the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/09/17/categorizing-oer-based-on-four-purposes/"">four possible purposes of OER</a> they are attempting to address. Below is a discussion about usage of the resources, based both on some of the literature, as well as interviews with professors and administrators. </em>Although schools are encouraged to make university-level courses open, or at least share them with other universities, there is no requirement for them to be openly published. However all provincial or national Top Level Courses Project have to be published openly for five years, and be regularly updated during this time (Liu Zenghui 2009; MoE 2004). As an example, Professor A2&rsquo;s course had already been published online, but with a password protection. After being selected as a Top Level Courses, they removed the password, and also greatly improved the content, by putting up recordings for every single lecture (required for the national level designation), and also posting student evaluation reports. In the process of creating the site, they often visited sites from other disciplines to see how they did it, and received inspiration from those examples. Professor A2 also recounted how they removed the password to all their material, when they were selected as a Top Level Course.Most professors believe that the resources are primarily for colleagues at other universities, although students can also use them. Professor A1 says that a lot of universities are using the material from their course, and that it has helped make the course quite influential in the whole country. She has personally been contacted by other professors who tell her about their use of the resources, and some of these have visited the university to learn more about the course. These are often from lower ranked universities, whereas she believes that universities at the same rank as her own might be more interested at looking abroad for course inspiration, something she has also done in her own work.Professor B2&rsquo;s course has also been very influential. It is one of only three or four similar courses available as Top Level Courses, yet this topic is taught in more than a hundred universities. He believes his course has had a large impact in raising the standard, and influencing the design of similar courses at many universities in China.The academic affairs office at Professor B1&rsquo;s university has said that the use rates of her course are very high. Her course is offered at all universities, so many professors consult her resources, and contact her for more information when they want to develop their own courses. Professor B2&rsquo;s course is also used by many teachers, and lately he has noticed that new courses that apply for the Top Level Courses designation use some of their thinking, even going so far as to copy certain expressions whole-sale from their course. Some of the teachers contacted him, and told him that they were basing part of their course on his materials, but others did not. In addition to this, the course is also popular among students who are going for the graduate school exam in his field, and want to understand the situation in the field better.Qin (2008) discusses how courses are &ldquo;marketed&rdquo;, and divides the channels into three. First, the Ministry of Education maintains websites (such as Jingpinke.com, see below), and distributes information to universities and other organizations. Secondly, the universities and individual professors themselves often publish their courses in newspapers, magazines, at meetings and in reports to other universities and colleges. Some universities have also published books listing all the Top Level Courses they have produced, with details from the application process. Finally, some voluntary associations, such as China Open Resources for Education, have organized information about Top Level Courses and created link and resource pages.There is not much in the literature about how students and teachers are using the Top Level Courses. Beijing City used external evaluators to conduct an in-depth study of the city-wide Top Level Courses Project in 2005, but most of the feedback was focused on how the materials were used in the class for which it was created &ndash; in other words, the course website functioned more as a generic learning management system.However, data also shows that while most students accessed material relevant to their current school work, a number of high school students used the material to check out interesting college courses, and some students accessed material purely related to their interests. Teachers also used the material to prepare for classes (Ding et al. 2005).<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Ebooks finally come to Norway,"books,libraries,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/11/25/e-books-finally-come-to-norway/,"I&#039;ve been waiting for this moment for quite a long time. Living outside of Norway for many years, I&#039;ve always been interested in technologies that enable me to access Norwegian culture from afar. I enjoy reading Norwegian newspapers online, I listen to a few podcasts from the national radio station, I follow some of the Norwegian intellectuals and academics on Twitter and through blogs, and I still await the time when the national broadcaster begins streaming in a format that works internationally.I also download Norwegian movies through bittorrent, and also listen to Norwegian audiobooks. As I&#039;ve begun reading more and more books on my iPod Touch, I&#039;ve been waiting eagerly for the time when I could access Norwegian books. The Swedes have been much more progressive here, the site <a href=""http://elib.se"">elib.se</a> offers thousands of Swedish audiobooks and ebooks for download, with most of them available as watermarked ePub files. They usually sell for around 50 SEK ($7), and work great with Stanza. I really enjoy reading Swedish crime, and have bought quite a few books through this website - even a few Norwegian books translated to Swedish, since this was the only way I could get them in e-format.In Norway, the publishers have been moving much more slowly. Partly, they complain that they have to pay VAT on ebooks and not on pbooks (paper books, a term I learnt from my Norwegian colleagues), and that this is unfair. I agree with them, but in Sweden they also have to pay VAT for ebooks, and they have a thriving market. A more likely explanation is that the big publishers also own bookstore chains, and are reluctant to take business away from the brick-and-mortar stores.I was also worried, because I read that they had all chosen Adobe Digital Editions as their DRM of choice. However, there was not a single app for iOS that could read ADE files, and thus I would be out of luck even in the future. However, two day, two great pieces of news came at once. First of all, Cappelen Damm, one of the largest publishers in Norway, with more than a 1000 new titles per year, have taken over the domain <a href=""http://digitalbok.no"">digitalbok.no</a>, and <a href=""http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/11/24/kultur/litteratur/bok/14429410/"">started their own ebook store</a>, without waiting for all the other publishers to get their act together.They currently offer about 500 Norwegian titles, as well as a selection of English titles. All the books are offered as ePubs protected by ADE. The second piece of good news, is that we now have an ebook reader for iOS that accepts ADE encrypted ePub files! I&#039;ve been waiting for this, and wondering what the problem was. This means that not only can I buy and read books from the Norwegian store, but a bunch of other stores using ADE, and even libraries that lend out books using ADE, are fair game!This app is called <a href=""http://www.bluefirereader.com/"">Bluefire Reader</a>, and has gained a lot of <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/blog/mobile-gadgeteer/the-ipad-may-be-the-best-universal-ebook-reader-thanks-to-bluefire-reader/4163"">positive press</a> (all the more strange that I never heard about it until today). So I installed the reader, purchased my first Norwegian book, and off I went. The book cost 99 NOK (about $16), which seems to be a fairly common price. More expensive than the Swedish bookstore, and I would definitively like to see cheaper books, but it&#039;s still within the ""pain-treshold"" (anything more expensive, and I would not buy). When I first tried out the website, I could not register, apparently they had some problems with too many people accessing (anyone who said there was no interest for ebooks in Norway?), but after a day, it worked fine. I bought the book, and had to use Adobe Digital Editions to download. This opened the file up, and I could read on my screen. But of course, I wasn&#039;t excited about being able to read the book on my MacBook, I wanted it on my iPod Touch.So I transferred the file through iTunes, opened it in Bluefire Reader, and it worked perfectly. Yay, after so many years, I am finally sitting in Toronto, reading a Norwegian crime novel on my futuristic little device. Amazing. I read about a third of the book this afternoon at a restaurant, waiting for my food (the writing is actually quite poor, but that is not the fault of the technology!)However, there are some details that still need to be improved. If you download a scanned pirate version of a book, you don&#039;t mind artifacts and poor formatting, but if you are paying exactly the same price as this book would cost as a paperback in Narvesen, you expect quality. The two things I noticed were a lot of words that were split with a space, and footnotes that appear in the middle of the text. Examples below:problem with spaces in the middle of words:<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/photo.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-758"" title=""photo"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/photo.png"" alt="""" width=""440"" height=""293"" /></a>and problem with footnotes in the middle of the text<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/photo2.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-759"" title=""photo(2)"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/photo2.png"" alt="""" width=""440"" height=""293"" /></a>As you see, these are relatively minor issues, but I don&#039;t think anyone would have accepted it if they appeared in a pbook, and I don&#039;t think we should accept them in an ebook.One interesting question becomes where the error appears - is it a problem with the file, or with the ebook reader. However, right now there is only one ebook reader that accepts ADE on iOS, and this reader is recommended on digitalbok.no&#039;s pages, so one should expect the books to work with it. Of course, normally I would have opened up the ePub, done a few search+replace or regexps, and fixed the problem, but that&#039;s impossible, since the files are encrypted. This also means that it&#039;s impossible for me to see if the file is well formatted, and it&#039;s Bluefire Reader&#039;s problem, or not.The reader works fairly well, although it enforces a very wide margin, which might work on the iPad, but takes far too much real estate on the iPod Touch. This doesn&#039;t seem to be adaptable through settings, which is peculiar, since it has settings for almost everything else (page transitions, etc).All in all, a great day, and I look forward to reading much more good Norwegian fiction in the future. Of course, once my Kindle arrives in a month or two (apparently there is a crazy backlog), I&#039;ll have to figure out how to break the ADE encryption, so I can put these books on the Kindle. Also, next time I am in Sweden, I have to make sure to get a library card, so I can borrow ebooks, rather than having to buy them!I hope the site is a success, and that other Norwegian publishers follow suit.Stian","Arne => ""One interesting question becomes where the error appears &ndash; is it a problem with the file, or with the ebook reader""  The errors you mention is the same errors that you previously found in the PDF versions of Digitalbok.no&#039;s books and not related to reading tool or format, but the quality of the conversion process from paper to ebook. . "The Jingpinke.com Portal for Chinese open courses,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,open-education,plenk2010,tech,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/11/25/the-jingpinke-com-portal-for-chinese-open-courses/,"Initially there were no easy ways of finding out about the Chinese open courses, except for going to each individual university&#039;s open course directory. There were some indices, but they were not very helpful.<blockquote>When the Top Level Courses Project was launched, there was no easy portal for discovering all the available courses. Each university built its own index site, and the Ministry of Education published links to all these sites, as well as to individual courses. Other organization, such as China Open Resources for Education, also created link sites that provided an overview of courses. These overviews contained little information, other than the name of the course, the university where it was taught, and the level of designation (university, provincial or national level).</blockquote>This strongly resembles the situation we still face today in the Western  world, with most courses being ""hidden"" behind their university&#039;s  sites. Sites like <a href=""http://videolectures.net/"">videolectures.net</a> have done a good job of lifting out the lecture videos and making them  much more available, however they ignore all the other material that is  published (syllabi, powerpoints, quizzes, etc).<blockquote>As the number of available courses grew, this became very unwieldy, and when the Top Level Courses Project was renewed in 2007, the new policy specified that a unified portal for all Top Level Courses would be built. The task of building and operating this portal went to the Higher Education Press, one of the largest publishers in China, which is owned by the Ministry of Education. They received some funding from the Ministry of Education, but were also supposed to find ways of earning some money themselves (Ju Feng, personal communications).</blockquote><blockquote>The site, located at http://jingpinke.com (Top Level Course in Chinese), is today a multi-facetted and rich site, with very advanced functionality. Visitors can browse through courses by discipline, university or level, and there are lists showing the most visited courses in different categories. For each course, the portal has imported a number of their resources into a resource database, so that you can look at individual PDFs, videos and other resources without leaving the portal.There are also many social &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; features: Logged in users can save courses to their personal page, rate courses, or leave comments. Users can also leave comments or questions around specific resources (individual documents and videos). When you visit a course, it also suggests other courses in the same category that you might be interested in (similar to Amazon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Other people who bought this book, also bought&hellip;&rdquo;). Each course profile also features a link to the actual course website.In addition to featuring all the Top Level Courses, the site is a clearing house for information about the project, with the latest policy and news updates, information on applying, courses and seminars that are held, etc. There is an overview of teaching material that has received prizes for excellence, and there is an interesting intra-university sharing portal. This is an entrepreneurial attempt to both promote sharing of more resources than the Top Level Courses Project covers, and to earn some funding for the operation of the website.</blockquote><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-25-at-9.59.17-PM.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-764"" title=""Screen shot 2010-11-25 at 9.59.17 PM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-25-at-9.59.17-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""452"" height=""292"" /></a>I have been very impressed by this site, and was very excited to get a chance to meet with Ju Feng, one of the senior people working on this project. He shared his insight about the entire Top Level Courses project, as well as the vision behind the Jingpinke.com site. The intra-university sharing portal, while not entirely ""OER"", is nonetheless an interesting attempt to get people to share even more stuff than the material from Top Level Courses.<blockquote><p style=""text-align: left;"">The portal is dependent on universities paying a subscription fee, and is thus different from the Top Level Courses material, which is all open to the world. Within this portal, any professor can then share material from any course. Apart from the fact that it is closed, the portal also differs because material does not have to be from a Top Level Course, and can represent only a small part of a course. For example, a teacher could share a particularly well-made Powerpoint-slideset, a recording, a 3D animation, or a document. There are similar social features attached to these resources, and a major part of the subscription fee collected from universities is paid out to content contributors, according to the popularity of their resources.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">This approach is in part an attempt to overcome the problem that many professors need more incentive to share their most valuable resources. In an interview with Chinese Distance Education, the head of the department for distance and continuing education at the Ministry of Education said that &ldquo;In the future we will see many kinds of sharing: both ""charitable"" and market-based, but right now we don&#039;t have the mechanisms for market-based sharing&rdquo; (Liu Zenghui 2009, under &ldquo;Jingpin kecheng jianshe reng cunzai bu zu&rdquo; 精品课程建设仍存在不足). The closed-community resource sharing model that Jingpinke.com has pioneered could be one such market-based approach to sharing.</p></blockquote><p style=""text-align: left;"">I am hoping to make a screencast in the future demonstration how the Jingpinke.com site works, since it is in Chinese, and it will be hard for most of the readers of this blog to explore the site by themselves. I think we could get a lot of inspiration on how to create a better site for exploring OpenCourseWare courses, regardless of which university they come from.</p><hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Commercial ecosystem around Chinese Top Level Courses,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,open-education,tech,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/11/26/commercial-ecosystem-around-chinese-top-level-courses/,"Over the years since the Top Level Courses Project was launched in 2003, an ecosystem of services and providers has grown up around it. The Ministry of Education organizes a number of conferences and training sessions, as do provincial boards of education. As described in the case studies, universities themselves will organize internal training, both bringing experienced course developers together with teams that are beginning to develop Top Level Courses, and also inviting external experts, and promoting exchange between different universities.China Open Resources for Education, a non-profit organization that will be described more fully in the next chapter, has held a number of national conferences around Open Educational Resources and the development of Top Level Courses. There are also a number of commercial actors in this space, both providing web development and hosting services, creating Content Management Systems that are tailored specifically to Top Level Courses, and providing training for teachers in developing Top Level Courses.For example, given that most Top Level Courses involve capturing lectures, <a href=""http://www.ava.com.cn/cn/ProductInfo.asp?id=411"">AVA Electronics</a> sells an integrated solution that can coordinate recording from several videocameras, capturing the presentation slides, and automatically publish this in an acceptable format. Similar lecture-capturing platforms are well-known in North America, but the interesting part is that this is being marketed as a &ldquo;Automated Top Level Courses Recording System&rdquo; (AVA 2010).<img src=""file:///Users/stian/Desktop/AVA1.png"" alt="""" /><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AVA1.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-769"" title=""AVA1"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AVA1.png"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""317"" /></a>And when it comes to specialized software, there are many options. For example, <a href=""http://www.51tek.com/category-476.html"">Hubei Huaqin Education Software Company</a>, which markets a large number of specialized platforms for purposes such as &ldquo;government news portal&rdquo;, &ldquo;membership management portal&rdquo; and &ldquo;online learning portal&rdquo;, has a specialized portal software for applying for and promoting Top Level Courses. They also promote a portal for coordinating the work of evaluating Top Level Courses according to the changing requirements each year (Huaqin 2010). Tsinghua University has also developed a portal for Top Level Courses, which is widely used (Han Xibin, personal communication).<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Huaqin.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-770"" title=""Huaqin"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Huaqin.png"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""130"" /></a>There is even <a href=""http://www.skyclass.cn/visual.htm"">Skyclass</a>&rsquo; &ldquo;3D Top Level Courses portal&rdquo;. On their website they warn that traditional course websites often make evaluators tired, having to flip back and forth between materials, whereas the 3D portal will encourage the use of the right side of the brain, and will leave a deep impression on course evaluators (Skyclass 2010a).<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/skyclass.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-771"" title=""skyclass"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/skyclass.png"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""307"" /></a>There are also many companies that offer to custom-build Top Level Course portals.

The courses last 2-3 days, and are held at various locations around the country, with some addressing general aspects of the development process, but most being discipline-specific (Jiaoshi wangluo peixun 2010).

Many pick up on the ambitious name &ldquo;Top Level Courses&rdquo;. Lu (2008) states that from his experience, many top professors are not willing to share the materials that they have been teaching for decades, and that he also had this fact confirmed by the Ministry of Education. He therefore does not believe that the courses deserve to be called &ldquo;Top Level&rdquo;. This concern is echoed by Professor A1, who says that she did not want to release all of her material on the web, because she had struggled for many years to create it, and does not want others to simply take it. However, she still put up most of her materials, whereas she knows other teachers who put up as little as they can get away with.Wang Xiuhua (2008) is sceptical about the commitment of producers of Top Level Courses, and believes that many simply &ldquo;go through the motions&rdquo; and do not take the opportunity to rethink their own pedagogical practices. Despite the rigorous evaluation criteria, he believes that many universities choose famous professors to &ldquo;put their name&rdquo; on courses. Many courses are not developed as part of an overall plan, but rather quickly put together in two months, to obtain ""fame"". Professor B3 is also worried about professors that enrol only to get recognition, and are not interested in continual improvement. These do not follow up constructive criticism of their courses, and after 3-4 years, their courses might not have changed at all.Even for professors that are committed to improving their own courses, there is a sense that the Top Level Courses process does not always support their work. Professor B1 is mainly positive, and believes that most of the things required are things that should be present in any good course. However, she is sceptical about the very detailed requirements on the constitution of the teaching teams. For some courses that are very small, this is not realistic. When she sees course applications listing a large number of people, she often wonders if they are really all involved in the course, or just lent their names to the application. She believes the requirement should be to have a course team that is appropriate for the kind of course, instead of a fixed requirement.There is also some concern about the increased formalization and bureaucratization of teaching. Professor B2 was very enthusiastic about teaching a few years ago, but now her enthusiasm is slowly disappearing. In addition to larger class sizes, she feels that she spends a lot of time on creating formalized lesson plans, and dealing with people who come to listen in on her class.There is also a problem with course websites not being maintained properly. Lu (2008) found that according to this tests, of the 1,100 national level Top Level Courses, over half were unavailable for one reason or another. Another survey by Qin (2008) shows that only 10% of all the material published in the &ldquo;early years&rdquo; of 2003-2005 is still available, and that most webpages have errors.Finally, there is the danger of focusing too much on the aesthetic aspects of the website, where some universities spend as much as 20-30% of the award money on hiring external web design companies, rather than focusing on the quality of the content (Wang Xiuhua 2008).<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",The future of Chinese Top Level Courses,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,open-education,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/11/29/the-future-of-chinese-top-level-courses/,"Nobody knows what the future holds for the Top Level Courses Project, which is scheduled to expire in 2010. It is probable that it will be renewed, but this could be done either with large-scale changes in organization, or relatively minor tweaks to assessment systems (Young 2010). Professor B3 believes that there will be more focus on producing material that can be used directly by students, and more focus on resource portals that organize this material. Another important step is to check all the courses that have already been produced &ndash;this was supposed to happen after a five-year period, but even though the first courses were produced seven years ago, it has not yet happened (Ju Feng, personal communications). As mentioned in the section on critiques, there are statistics showing that many courses are no longer available, or have not been updated.According to Ju Feng, vice-director of the Top Level Courses Project Resource Center (精品课程资源中心) which produces Jingpinke.com, the Ministry of Education is planning for a shift in the role and function of the Open University of China. When it was initially built, it was intended as a stop-gap solution for students that could not be admitted to regular universities because of capacity problems. Given the rapid expansion of the regular system, almost all students who now go through the university entrance exam (gaokao, 高考) are assured a spot at a university, even though it might not be the university they wanted.Therefore, the focus of the Open University of China will shift from undergraduate degree programs to life-long learning and continuing education. The 2010-2020 ten year master plan for educational development in China released by the Ministry of Education calls for 350 million people involved in life-long and continuing learning by 2020 (<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/02/28/key-numbers-from-chinas-2010-2020-education-plan/"">Hklev 2010</a>). Although we have seen little evidence of Top Level Courses being used for that purpose today, it could be one possible future direction.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",Comparison of Chinese Top Level Courses with MIT OpenCourseWare,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,open-education,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/11/29/comparison-of-chinese-top-level-courses-with-mit-opencourseware/,"This is far from the first study to compare the Chinese Top Level Courses Project with MIT OpenCourseWare, there have already been a number of Chinese papers;<blockquote>There have been a number of studies published in Chinese that compare MIT OpenCourseWare with the Top Level Courses Project. Wang Hongju (2009) sees the purpose of MIT OpenCourseWare as spreading quality resources throughout the world, whereas the Top Level Courses Project is aimed to increase communication internally between universities in China, and improve the quality of teaching. Together with Zhou Yan (2009) and Yang, Wang and Luo (2007) he also praises their unified technological platform, and what he describes as a very rigorous project evaluation methodology.</blockquote>However, none of these papers employ any kind of theoretical framework for their comparison, and they are also usually too eager to show how far behind the West China is.<blockquote>While these papers all bring up interesting points, they are not very comprehensive comparative studies, and fail to employ any kind of framework or theory to discuss the two projects. They also consistently hold MIT OpenCourseWare up as a positive example, and portray the Top Level Courses Project as a weak copy in need of improvement. Instead of seeing the Top Level Courses Project as a weak copy of the MIT OpenCourseWare model, I would like to understand it on its own terms. I will first use the typology introduced in chapter two to analyze how the purposes behind these two projects differ. I will then use two different ways of conceptualizing OpenCourseWare as a framework to analyze the influence of MIT on the Chinese project, and finally discuss why the international community has reached misleading conclusions about the Chinese project.</blockquote><hr /><strong>Comparison based on typology of purposes</strong>The four categories <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/09/17/categorizing-oer-based-on-four-purposes/"">I listed in chapter two</a> were transformative production, direct use, reuse, and transparency/consultation. In this section we will use these four categories to look at the differences between the OpenCourseWare model that was promoted by MIT, and now has been adopted by many other universities around the world, and the Top Level Courses Project in China.<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Transformative production</span>The first category, transformative production, is the most significant difference between the two models. There is no doubt that publishing courses online will always have some impact on the people involved with the course, but at MIT, this was never an explicit goal. There is no selection procedure for courses, rather the goal is to have all courses being produced. Rather than fostering reflection and engagement through the creation of the OpenCourseWare courses, the procedure was set up in a way to minimize the work-load for teachers &ndash; they just have to hand over the material they were already using for classes to a group of specially trained workers, who vet the material for copyright, and post it online.In the case of Japan, modernizing the lecture styles of professors was mentioned as one of the motivations (see below), and it is possible that universities in other countries also saw this as a way to make professors more ambitious about their teaching methods, and perhaps &ldquo;learn from the example of MIT lecturers&rdquo;. However, it is never mentioned very explicitly in the justifications, rather the target is always the creation of a collection of materials (which can be classified according to the three next categories).In China, however, the transformative effect of the production process is one of the main, or perhaps the main justification for the project. In chapters four and five, I have argued that the Top Level Courses Project grows out of a long tradition of course evaluations and competitions to select excellent units, which would receive extra funding and act as examples for others. When discussing the goals of the project, most of the concrete goals are related to the impact of the production of resources, for example the creation of teaching-teams, which is supposed to entice full-professors to teach undergraduate courses, train young professors, and foster intra-collegial reflection around the courses (something that has a long tradition in China, as I noted a bit earlier). Different from MIT and projects in other countries, professors in China are not supposed to submit snapshots of what they are teaching right now, but go through a process of research and refinement, improving both the teaching methods and pedagogy, and updating the content.The project also aims to increase the technological literacy of professors, which will be reflected in their teaching towards their own students, and to inspire a greater focus on quality, and educational reform and innovation, not only among the professors directly involved with the production of Top Level Courses, but by the entire departments or universities involved. And when I interviewed professors and administrators about the effects and impact the Top Level Courses Project has had, both for individual professors, who have had a single course designed as a Top Level Course, and for administrators who assessed the impact on their entire institution, almost all the comments I received were about the impact of the process itself.This focus on the process can also be seen from the web resources generated. We saw in chapter five that most of the courses had already gone through several rounds of internal competitions to become excellent courses. One of the main differences between the Top Level Courses Project and evaluation projects that have come before it, is the requirement to share resources online. However, the main purpose of the website is to act as a platform for the application process, and the website is assessed on how well it reflects on the course as it is taught in a physical classroom, by looking at the teaching plan, representative recordings of lectures, student evaluations, justifications and reflections around the course by professors, etc.This innovation enables a more efficient and standardized review-process, involving blind peer-review by expert committees consisting of faculty members from all over China. Once the designation has been given, this same website which was used to apply, is then opened up to the public, with very few modifications. The main consideration in designing the website is therefore which materials are necessary to properly evaluate the quality of a course taught in a classroom, not which resources would be most useful to other professors, or to distance learners.<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Resources shared</span>If we look at the actual resources produced by the Top Level Courses Project and the OpenCourseWare projects in other countries, there are both similarities and differences. There is a very large diversity of Open Educational Resources projects in existence, and I have chosen to compare the Top Level Courses Project with the OpenCourseWare model here, both because internationally it has been believed to be a kind of OpenCourseWare, and because OpenCourseWare pioneered the publication of an entire course as an open resource, or collection of open resources, and this is similar to what the Top Level Courses Project produces.In both cases, the result is one website per course, listing a number of resources. Almost every course will have a course outline, often with slides for each lecture, a reading list, and many will have supplementary material, audio and video recordings of some or all lectures, past exam questions, student works, etc. Top Level Courses will usually be much more complete and refined than for example MIT OpenCourseWare courses, and the effort that goes into production of the former is far larger, however the principle is the same.If we analyze this material using the three remaining categories from our framework, we find that neither project is particularly suited to direct learning by students. Course websites for both models are designed to reflect the teaching that happens in a classroom, and have not been designed for effective online or distance learning. This does not mean that students do not use the course websites for this purpose; it is certainly possible to learn a lot for someone who is an independent learner, but it is clearly not the primary consideration when the courses are produced.The reuse category is where we find the largest discrepancy between the OpenCourseWare model, and the Top Level Courses Project. Almost all international OpenCourseWare projects use an open Creative Commons license that allows others to download, modify, and redistribute derivations of the material, as long as the re-distributor does not make a profit. This means that although MIT&rsquo;s courses might not be well suited for distance learning &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;, someone else can instead repurpose parts of courses, and put them together into something quite different &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s an online course, a textbook or a documentary. The most common example of this reuse is translation, which CORE has been involved with. Granted, the resources published by MIT are not ideal for reuse, because they are often published in file-formats that are difficult to edit (such as PDFs), but the license at least allows people to try.In addition to this, the concept of reuse and derivation is frequently promoted by the OpenCourseWare Consortium, which has hosted many presentations on this topic at their annual conferences. On the other hand, none of the copious literature on the Top Level Courses Project mentions the possibility of reuse, and the courses are not licensed with an open license that would permit this legally. This is not just different from the OpenCourseWare model, but a deviation from the entire Open Educational Resources movement, which would lead many Open Educational Resources advocates to state that the Top Level Courses Project could not be counted as an Open Educational Resources project.When we examine the final category, transparency/consultation, we find that the two projects are very similar. Both have the express purpose of letting great courses inspire other teachers, and sharing best examples of teaching and course design. In China, these are the best courses, because they have been rigorously selected as such, and at MIT, the courses are considered the best, because they all come from an elite university. In addition to inspiring teachers at other institutions, literature from both projects also talks about students using their courses to better understand what is required by a certain major, the courses promoting collaboration between different universities, etc. To fulfill this purpose, it is actually a positive thing that the material online closely reflects what goes on in the actual classroom, and has not been extensively modified to be better suited for distance learners.In this section, I applied the framework of four purposes which I introduced in chapter two, and found that although the OpenCourseWare model and the Top Level Courses Project are similarly poorly suited to direct distance learners, and well suited to the purposes of transparency and consultation, they differ radically on the two other categories. The Top Level Courses Project has transformative production as one of its main purposes, which is not even mentioned in the MIT literature, whereas MIT OpenCourseWare courses are fairly well suited for reuse, and this is encouraged, which is absolutely not the case with Top Level Courses.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li>Download this thesis: <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">PDF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.doc"">DOC</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.odt"">ODT</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.rtf"">RTF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.epub"">ePub</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.mobi"">Mobi (Kindle)</a></li><li><a href=""http://http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />","Comparing Chinese Top Level Courses with MIT | => [...] Top Level Courses with&nbsp;MIT  Posted on December 2, 2010 by openedblogger| Leave a comment   Stian Haklev has a new post comparing Chinese Top Level Courses with MIT. From the post:  In China, however, the [...]. "The impact of MIT’s OpenCourseWare model on the Top Level Courses Project,"academia/research,Education,MA thesis,open-education,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/12/01/the-impact-of-mit%e2%80%99s-opencourseware-model-on-the-top-level-courses-project/,"In this thesis, I have tried to show that the Top Level Courses Project is a unique Chinese answer to national challenges, and not an imported model. When the centralized curriculum, which was introduced through borrowing from the Soviet Union in the 1950&rsquo;s, was gradually loosened up in the 1980&rsquo;s, it was replaced with a system of course evaluations to promote quality and maintain a central direction for courses. As these systems of course evaluation became increasingly sophisticated and widespread, the Ministry of Education embarked on a number of major projects to select excellent universities and faculties through peer-review processes for extra funding, and to serve as examples to others. Adding the explosion of enrolment beginning in 1998, and the ministry&rsquo;s strong desire to promote increased use of IT in education, a new national program that would evaluate the best courses, and share these using an online platform is a natural development of the different trends that already existed.However, China does not exist in a vacuum, and during the same time, the MIT OpenCourseWare model was developed, and became highly publicized, within China as in many other places. Many articles have been published in China, both introducing the OpenCourseWare project in general terms, and comparing the OpenCourseWare project with the Top Level Courses Project (as mentioned above). To analyze how the OpenCourseWare project could have had an impact on the Top Level Courses Project, we need to decide on how to conceptualize the OpenCourseWare project.<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">OpenCourseWare as a norm</span>One way of conceiving of the OCW concept is to see it as the normative ideal that all universities should digitize and open access to their course materials. The Hewlett Foundation (2006) states the normative idea thus:<blockquote>At the heart of the movement toward Open Educational Resources is the simple and powerful idea that the world&rsquo;s knowledge is a public good and that technology in general and the Worldwide Web in particular provide an extraordinary opportunity for everyone to share, use, and reuse knowledge. OER are the parts of that knowledge that comprise the fundamental components of education content and tools for teaching, learning and research.</blockquote>But for our purposes, let us suggest the norm that &ldquo;universities should make their educational material openly available&rdquo;. Finnemore and Sikkink (2005) have developed a theory of norm life-cycles, and used it to analyze the spread of women&rsquo;s suffrage and the land-mine ban, among other activist movements. As opposed to a realist view of the world, where each nation only looks after their own best interests, they hold a constructivist view that advocates for the possibility of creation and spreading of norms in a global context. They define a norm as &ldquo;a standard of appropriate behaviour for actors with a given identity&rdquo;. Norms are learnt through social learning, or through contestation, and lead to a change in identity and internal values and motivation, ie. they are transformative (Checkel 1999).According to Finnemore and Sikkink (2005), norms are created by norm entrepreneurs, who are critical to a norm&rsquo;s emergence, because they call attention to the issues, and use language that &ldquo;names, interprets and dramatizes them&rdquo;. These norm entrepreneurs need some kind of organizational platform to stand on especially at the international level, and indeed, in order for a norm to reach a threshold and move towards a cascade, it will often have to become institutionalized in a specific set of international rules and organizations.A cascade occurs after a tipping point has been reached, typically comprising a third of all states. Finally, the norm becomes internalized, and sometimes it can become so institutionalized that people follow it blindly, without reflecting on the consequences. Finnemore and Sikkink (2005, 913) use the international state system as an example of a norm that has become internalized beyond reflection; &ldquo;actors no longer think seriously about whether &lsquo;&lsquo;the state&rsquo;&rsquo; is the best or most efficient form of political organization (it almost certainly is not). They just set up more and more states to the exclusion of other political forms.&rdquo;MIT and Hewlett could certainly be said to play the role of a norm entrepreneur, and together with UNESCO, they have spent a lot of energy framing open education in a way that will make it attractive to other actors. They also attempt to spread the model through international advocacy networks, using OpenCourseWare Consortium as a platform, and they have defined minimum standards that institutions have to fulfill, to be eligible to join &ndash; a minimum of 10 courses, and the use of open licenses, for example. And in fact, one might even see a parallel to the internalization of the idea, at least within the movement, where people are frantically trying to convince every single university to make OpenCourseWare, without stopping to think about whether that is the best use of resources in all cases.So if OpenCourseWare represents a norm, has this norm had any impact on the Top Level Courses Project? I would argue that it has not, based on three reasons. Firstly, one of the core normative values behind OpenCourseWare and most Open Educational Resources projects is openness, which includes using an open license. However, the Top Level Courses Project does not require courses to use an open license, and in fact I have not come across a single course that uses an open license (and on being questioned, course authors all said that they would not allow reuse and repurposing of their materials &ndash; one of the basic concepts within the global open education movement).Secondly, much of the impetus behind the project comes from the idealistic notion that educational resources should be available to all, and to spread access to people who do not have it today. However, despite the fact that university enrolment is still lower in China than in major Western countries (even after the process of massification), increasing access to education is never mentioned, whether in official documents, or by my informants. The Top Level Courses Project aims to increase quality for those already in the system, not to reach people who do not currently have access. The task of providing expanded access is entrusted to other initiatives, such as Open University of China (Wei 2008).Finally, if the norm mentioned above had had any impact in China, we would expect to see a range of different experiments with making educational resources freely available, both by individual professors and by individual universities, like the case in North America or other regions of the world. This has not been the case &ndash; other than the Top Level Courses Project, which was initiated and funded by the Ministry of Education, there are very few examples of academics voluntarily sharing resources. One of the only exceptions is the SocialLearn Lab network started by Professor Zhuang Xiuli at Beijing Normal University (SocialLearnLab 2010). Given these reasons, I find it hard to conclude that OpenCourseWare has had much impact in China as a norm.<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Openness as a policy innovation</span>In the previous section, I have presented the open education movement as essentially idealistic and normative. However, in addition to choosing to share one&rsquo;s resources freely because of an ideological conviction; utility and pragmatic considerations count as other very important factors. I will first discuss how this factor plays out in the wider open movement, and then look at examples that pertain to OpenCourseWare.It is easy to understand why users would be attracted to free resources, but why would producers, whether they are software companies, or universities, benefit from waiving their rights, and making their products freely available? The fact is that many large commercial companies have open-sourced their own software, or have engineers that contribute to outside open-source projects. Hecker (2000) runs through a number of reasons why commercial companies would want to open-source their products, and discusses different business models that can make this process sustainable (see also Behlendorf 1999). Widening the scope to encompass many open practices, Tapscott and Williams (2006) outline a number of innovative business practices that allow corporations to benefit from opening access to their internal processes and intellectual property, leveraging peer-to-peer collaborators and &ldquo;prosumers&rdquo;.How does this apply to OpenCourseWare &ndash; are there good pragmatic arguments for a university to open access to its course materials, without having recourse to moral arguments? The MIT Evaluation Report lists a number of examples of how MIT OCW has benefitted MIT as an institution (MIT OpenCourseWare 2005). OpenCourseWare can help in recruitment, which is shown by the fact that 35% of freshmen aware of OCW before deciding to attend MIT were influenced by it in choosing which school to attend, and a large majority of alumni believed that it strengthened MIT&rsquo;s reputation (p. 52, 60). It can also be very useful for existing students, who according to the report use the courses extensively to catch up or repeat classes, and plan their course of study (p. 50).Even faculty find it useful to be able to consult other colleagues&rsquo; work. One interesting example of this is professor Karen Willcox who teaches astronautics, a course that requires a strong foundation in maths. She was dismayed by the poor level of math skills, and realized that she did not know what was taught in the math course that was required for entry to the astronautics course, or how the material was presented. Through the OCW site, she was able to review the material, and can now help the students make explicit links between her material and the pure math that they have previously studied (ibid., p. 58). In the same vein, when the OpenCourseWare Consortium tries to help faculty members and students &ldquo;sell&rdquo; the idea of OpenCourseWare to their administration and other faculty, they list a range of direct benefits to institutions, rather than appealing to moral and ethical values (OpenCourseWare Consortium 2010b, 2010c, 2010d, 2010e).If we consider OpenCourseWare not as something that is normatively good, but as something that is pragmatically useful to an institution, or a state, then it is much easier to make the case for OpenCourseWare having had an impact on the Top Level Courses Project. While it is very difficult to define exactly the extent to which OpenCourseWare helped trigger the development of the Top Level Courses Project in exactly the form it exists today, many of the perceived benefits of MIT that were listed above are echoed by the professors interviewed in chapter five. Through my interviews and literature review, I found that people working in the education sector were very well aware of MIT OpenCourseWare and other open projects, but professors in other disciplines who had courses that were selected as Top Level Courses knew very little about it.Tan Feng (2008) believes that the Top Level Courses Project was China&rsquo;s response to the MIT project, and it is certainly possible that given all the underlying trends and problems discussed above, the 2001 announcement of MIT&rsquo;s grand plan, and it&rsquo;s positive reaction, functioned as some sort of trigger to create the Top Level Courses Project. This is strengthened by Phillips&rsquo; (2004) theory of policy attraction, which proposes that states will be more likely to borrow policy during times of political change, systemic collapse, internal dissatisfaction, negative external evaluation, new configuration and alliances, knowledge and skills innovation, or the aftermath of extreme upheaval &ndash; the explosive growth in enrolment during the period of massification could thus have made China more open to borrowing ideas from the outside.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li>Download this thesis: <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">PDF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.doc"">DOC</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.odt"">ODT</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.rtf"">RTF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.epub"">ePub</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.mobi"">Mobi (Kindle)</a></li><li><a href=""http://http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />","Case studies of OpenCourseWare in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea","academia/research,asia,Education,MA thesis,open-education,p2pU,plenk2010,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/12/02/case-studies-of-opencourseware-in-japan-taiwan-and-south-korea/,"<em>In this post, I will introduce the development of OpenCourseWare projects in three Asian countries that are close to China both geographically and culturally.

Later, in 2004, people from MIT gave an invited lecture about MIT OpenCourseWare at Tokyo Tech in July 2004, and after that, the first meeting of the Japan OpenCourseWare Alliance was held with four Japanese universities. These had mainly been recruited through the efforts of MIT professor Miyagawa, and his personal contacts. In one case, the connection was the former president of Tokyo University being an acquaintance of Charles Vest, the former president of MIT (Makoshi 2006).Subsequently, in 2006 the OpenCourseWare International Conference was held at Kyoto University, and at that conference, the Japan OpenCourseWare Association was reorganized into the Japan OpenCourseWare Consortium (Kobayashi and Kawafuchi 2006). By 2010, they had 1285 courses in Japanese and 212 courses in English, with 23 university members, including the United Nations University (JOCW 2010).The motivation for joining the OCW movement seems to have been to create positive change among Japanese universities, including modernizing presentation styles among lecturers, as well as sharing learning material (Makoshi 2006).<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Taiwan</span><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-30-at-12.52.33-AM.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-822"" title=""Screen shot 2010-11-30 at 12.52.33 AM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-30-at-12.52.33-AM.png"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""275"" /></a>In Taiwan, it all began with the translation of MIT OpenCourseWare courses, which was organized by Lucifer Chu. He is well known in Taiwan for being the translator of the Lord of the Rings, and he used the royalties from this work to fund what would later be called the Opensource OpenCourseWare Prototype System (OOPS). In February 2004, the entire MIT OCW site was copied to a local server hosted in Taiwan, and a network of volunteer Chinese-speakers from Taiwan, China and other countries collaborated on translating the courses to Chinese. In late 2006, the project secured a grant from the Hewlett foundation, and in June 2007, OOPS hosted its first international conference on OCW and e-learning in Taiwan (Lee, Lin and Bonk 2007).<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-30-at-12.51.33-AM.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-824"" title=""Screen shot 2010-11-30 at 12.51.33 AM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-30-at-12.51.33-AM.png"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""340"" /></a>At the same time, universities in Taiwan were also beginning to develop their own open material. The National Chiaotung University in Taiwan joined the OpenCourseWare Consortium in April 2007, and launched their own OpenCourseWare collection in June of the same year. Currently, they provide 71 courses, 54 of which are recorded in real classes during the semester (Lee Haishuo, personal communication). They also provide discussion boards to facilitate interaction between self-learners and online teaching assistants, to nurture a self-learning environment. This self-learning can then lead to official certification from the university, even for outside students, after sitting a certification exam. Sitting the exam is free, and only requires completing an application procedure (NCTU 2010, Lee 2010).In 2007, a number of other universities followed the National Chiaotung University, and joined the international OpenCourseWare Consortium. The National Chiaotung University began outreach in early 2008, to invite other universities to form a national association, and on the 24th of December, Taiwan OpenCourseWare Consortium was officially formed, with 18 founding university members (TOCW 2010). However, several of these members left because they were hoping that they would get subsidies from the government to produce OpenCourseWare, and when they found out that this would not happen, many left (Lee Haishuo, personal communications).The different universities have their own specialties. For example, the National Chiaotung University has continued developing their basic science courses and offering them to other universities and self-learners, Taiwan University and National Chengchi University focus on basic education, National Taiwan Normal University offers courses on the classics, and National Taiwan Ocean University, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology and National Sun Yat-Sen University have all offered courses related to their specialties (TOCW 2010).<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">South Korea</span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-30-at-12.52.07-AM.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-823"" title=""Screen shot 2010-11-30 at 12.52.07 AM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-30-at-12.52.07-AM.png"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""280"" /></a></span>In South Korea, the OpenCourseWare movement started with professor Gyutae Kim, who was a professor of electrical engineering at Korea University. He had learnt about the MIT initiative, and was eager to start something similar in Korea. He initially proposed this to the School of Engineering, but received little support. Later, as the Director of the Center for Teaching and Learning in the same university, he received the dean&rsquo;s permission to pilot an OpenCourseWare project, but without any funding (Meena Hwang, personal communication).Gyutae Kim and his staff got strong support from MIT and the OpenCourseWare Consortium. They participated in the OpenCourseWare Consortium meeting in Santander, Spain, in May 2007, and learnt about an open source platform for publishing OpenCourseWare called EduCommons. John Dehlin, then director of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, later gave an online presentation about the OpenCourseWare concept, which lent important credibility to the pilot project at Korea University.In April 2008, the Korean OpenCourseWare Consortium was formed, consisting of five universities: Handong Global University, Inha University, Kyung Hee University, Busan National University of Education and Seoul National University of Technology. However, there is not strong buy-in from presidents and staff at these universities, and aversion by staff members to add to professors&rsquo; work burden, which has slowed down the development of the project.The national evaluation of universities is very important to Korean universities, and traditionally has only looked at research, thus making things that do not result in publications less of a priority. Recently, there has been an increased focus on teaching and learning from the Ministry of Education, which for example mandated centers for teaching and learning at each university in 2006.A large project to improve the quality of teaching that was recently launched, called the ACE project, will disburse USD $800,000 each year for four years. This project, which is spearheaded by the president of Korea OpenCourseWare Consortium, Dr. Kim Young Sup, included the production of OpenCourseWare in the evaluation criteria for applicants, and all ten universities that won have planned OpenCourseWare projects in the future.KERIS, a government subsidized organization that coordinates the production of electronic resources for Korean Universities, has also become involved in the opening of resources. Since 2007, it has paid universities to create thousands of e-learning modules. Recently, it has contacted the universities that produced these modules under contract, and asked them to open up at least part of them to the public (Meena Hwang, personal communications).<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">A common East-Asian model</span>Thus in all these cases, there is an initial contact between MIT and leading universities in the host country. Sometimes this happens through outreach by MIT faculty or administrators, and sometimes it is individuals who come in touch with the OpenCourseWare movement, and decide to try to spread the idea at their university, and nationally. Universities decide to join the OpenCourseWare Consortium individually, and to form a national non-governmental association or federation to coordinate the work of producing OpenCourseWare.These organizations and efforts might receive support from the Ministries of Education, but are not funded or organized by the national governments. Given the way these federations began life, as international collaborations, they remain very internationally accessible. Websites are often available in English as well as in national languages, researchers frequently visit international conferences or publish in international journals, and often use the open-source platforms for hosting OpenCourseWare that have been developed by US universities.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">Download the canonical PDF version</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />","OCW in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan | => [...] Japan, South Korea and&nbsp;Taiwan  Posted on December 4, 2010 by openedblogger| Leave a comment   Stian Hklev has a new post about OpenCourseWare in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

So how could the international community so thoroughly misunderstand what was going on in China for over 7 years?</em><hr />In September 2003, a number of the pioneers behind the MIT OpenCourseWare project, and a representative from the Hewlett Foundation which had funded the MIT OpenCourseWare Project, attended a meeting with Chinese universities at the Beijing Jiaotong University. The meeting had been organized by Dr. Fun-Den Wang, a retired mining professor from Colorado, who is also the head of the International Engineering Technology Foundation (IET), an educational charity. Dr. Fun-Den Wang was impressed by the vision behind MIT&rsquo;s OpenCourseWare Project, and wanted to make these resources available to Chinese universities. The result of the meeting was the founding of an organization called China Open Resources for Education (zhongguo kaifang jiaoyu ziyuan lianheti, 中国开放教育资源联合体), which would promote closer interaction and open sharing of educational resources between China and the world (CORE 2010a).China Open Resources for Education (CORE) began facilitating the use of MIT OpenCourseWare by universities in China. They hosted a mirror of all the courses, so that they could be accessed more rapidly from computers within China, and funded the translation of some of the courses into Chinese (CORE 2010b). To date, their website lists 602 foreign courses that have been translated into Chinese (CORE 2010c). They held several conferences about Open Educational Resources in China (2006 in Xi&rsquo;an and 2007 in Beijing), and in 2008 they co-hosted, with the OpenCourseWare Consortium, the international &ldquo;Open Education Conference 2008&rdquo; at Dalian University of Technology. This conference attracted researchers and administrators from around China, and around the world (CORE 2010b).After a while, internationally CORE became synonymous with the Top Level Courses Project, which they called China Quality OpenCourseWare. Very little has been written about it in English, but what little there is tends to portray the project as a derivation of the MIT OpenCourseWare, with CORE as the founder and organizer. For example, Stephen Carson (2009), external relations director for MIT OpenCourseWare writes in an article in Open Learning:In 2004 collaboration between the Chinese Ministry of Education and MIT&#039;s translation partner CORE would lead to the launch of the China Quality OpenCourseWare project, an effort to openly publish the best courses from across the Chinese higher education system. By mid-2005, materials from more than 500 Chinese courses were available through the CORE site. This collection of courseware has now grown to over 1600 total courses, some of which are now being translated into English by the CORE team.David Wiley (2007, 4) writes in a report to the Organization for Economic Collaboration and Development that &ldquo;in China 451 courses have been made available by 176 university members of the China Open Resources for Education (CORE) consortium&rdquo;. Finally, Elpida Makriyannis (2010), a researcher with the Open University Open Learning Network, set up to coordinate research on worldwide Open Educational Resources efforts, describes the development of China Quality OpenCourseWare as springing out of the fateful meeting to establish CORE in September, 2003.In fact, the Top Level Courses Project was launched in March 2003, half a year before the MIT meeting, and was not even mentioned at the meeting half a year later, where the discussion centered around the translation of MIT OpenCourseWare courses into Chinese (Duan Chenggui and Liu Meifeng, personal communications). So how could this misunderstanding have spread?<strong>The spread of an understandable myth</strong>To imagine that China Open Resources for Education organized Chinese universities into producing China Quality OpenCourseWare is natural, when you think of the organization of similar projects in most other countries, see for example <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/12/02/case-studies-of-opencourseware-in-japan-taiwan-and-south-korea/"">the case studies from the surrounding East-Asian territories</a> of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. At first sight therefore, the Chinese story seems to fit perfectly into this image. A meeting is organized between MIT and top Chinese universities, an organization is founded, and this organization coordinates the production of open course material. Even the name the project is known under internationally, China Quality OpenCourseWare, indicates that it is a direct continuation of MIT&rsquo;s project.As we have seen in the previous chapters, the Top Level Courses Project is something quite different however. It can trace its roots back to the unique system for course evaluations and quality improvement that developed in China since 1985, and was developed as a response to the unprecedented pace of massification of higher education in China, and the desire to promote pedagogical reform and increased use of IT in education. The way of organizing the project, the funding mechanism, and the goals are all different from the OpenCourseWare projects in other countries.Yet this information was not readily available. The Ministry of Education has webpages with information in English about the higher education system in China, but none of these mention the Top Level Courses Project. No official publication has ever been put out that introduces the Top Level Courses Project in English. In fact, it does not even have an official English translation, which has led to a multitude of different translations (China Quality OpenCourseWare, NPWDEC, Top-Quality Courses, etc). Although more than 3,000 academic papers have been published about aspects of this project in Chinese academic journals, until recently no significant paper had been published in English.This is thus a prime example of the need to look below the surface, as Schriewer and Martinez (2004) stated, and examine whether the terms we are employing in fact describe the same thing. China Quality OpenCourseWare sounds like just another OpenCourseWare, fitting perfectly in with the other examples in East Asia, and a great example of world institutionalism, with both organizational models, and values converging. As we saw above, however, the values inherent in the OpenCourseWare model seem not to have rubbed off on China, and although the project might have been inspired in some aspects by the MIT OpenCourseWare project, it is fundamentally different in organization, purpose, and presumably outcome. To grasp this however, a deep understanding of the context of Chinese higher education, and its history are needed.In this case, it is not the state that is using &ldquo;Ausland als Argument&rdquo; (Schrieweer and Martinez 2004). Given the positive attitudes toward MIT OpenCourseWare by Chinese academics and students, the government could very well have named this project &ldquo;China Quality OpenCourseWare&rdquo; and tried to let their substantially different project benefit from MIT&rsquo;s fame, but they never attempted to do such a thing. It is also not the case, as Steiner-Khamsi and Stolpe (2006) found in Mongolia, that the state is using specific terms to attract foreign funders. In fact, the Ministry of Education has chosen not to engage internationally at all around this project, not releasing any information in English, nor even providing an official English translation of the project.Into this void stepped the organization China Open Resources for Education. They were able to get international recognition, and funding, because the world believed they were promoting an international model in China. According to Steiner-Khamsi and Quist (2000), many local NGOs master &ldquo;NGO-speak&rdquo; and focus exclusively on initiatives for which they are likely to get international funding. In addition, the funder, in this case the Hewlett foundation, willingly went along.Steiner-Khamsi describes international organizations that have developed a portfolio of &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;, as well as corresponding management structure that serves the dissemination and supervision of these practice, such as Save the Children U.S. and community based education, the Open Society Institute/Soros Foundation and critical thinking, or DANIDA and student-centered learning (Steiner-Khamsi 2004). The Hewlett Foundation has also built up a large portfolio of open education projects, and it was easy for them to fund a Chinese project that looked similar to what they were used to.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li>Download this thesis: <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">PDF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.doc"">DOC</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.odt"">ODT</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.rtf"">RTF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.epub"">ePub</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.mobi"">Mobi (Kindle)</a></li><li><a href=""http://http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",The power of personal relationships in the spread of the OpenCourseWare model,"academia/research,Education,MA thesis,open-education,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/12/06/the-power-of-personal-relationships-in-the-spread-of-the-opencourseware-model/,"We saw in the cases of other East Asian countries how personal relationships often played a key role in introducing the idea of OpenCourseWare to new societies, and this is true even in China as far as the limited role of China Open Resources for Education goes. This is quite consistent with much of the literature on policy diffusion. For example, Mintrom (1997) has studied how policy entrepreneurs can play a role in spreading policy between states in the US, and also how membership in professional organizations and networks can assist this spreading of norms. He defines policy entrepreneurs as &ldquo;people who seek to initiate dynamic policy change&rdquo;, which they do through attempting to win support for ideas for policy innovations.The strategies available to them are identifying problems, networking in policy circles, shaping the terms of the policy debates and building coalitions. They also face the challenge of crafting arguments differently for different audiences, while maintaining an image of integrity. He posits that policy entrepreneurs have the following commonalities with business entrepreneurs: they are able to spot problems, to take risks to promote innovative approaches to problem solving, and they have the ability to organize others to help turn policy ideas into government policies (Mintrom, 1997).He also surveyed the spread of the idea of school choice among.different states, and tested out theories about which states were closest geographically, and which were most similar, but it turned out that what mattered was who sent officials to the same education conferences. Certainly it is the case that OpenCourseWare has not spread to the countries that are closest to the US, nor to the countries that are the most similar in structure.In his discussion, he lists how professional networks can work as conduits for policy ideas, and platforms for policy entrepreneurs (Mintrom and Vergari 1998). These issue networks are institutionalized in the form of associations, journals, newletters, list-serves and conferences, and seem to promote what Granovetter (1973) called &ldquo;weak ties&rdquo; between different groups. Successful policy entrepreneurs are able to maintain these weak ties to different clusters of stakeholders that are spread throughout the globe (Steiner-Khamsi 2004a; 2004b).An interesting case of the impact of one networked individual is what Gita Steiner-Khamsi (2006) calls the &ldquo;Maris O&rsquo;Rourke&rdquo; effect. She was a New Zealander instrumental in the development of outcomes-based education (OBE) there in the 1970&rsquo;s, and when she moved to the US, OBE travelled with her. In fact, the tipping point which gave OBE a world career happened at the same time as O&rsquo;Rourke entered the World Bank. This is a wonderful example of one individual playing a pivotal role in disseminating a policy innovation. We could easily replace O&rsquo;Rourke with Catherine Casserly from the Hewlett Foundation, or Shigeru Miyagawa from MIT.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li>Download this thesis: <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">PDF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.doc"">DOC</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.odt"">ODT</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.rtf"">RTF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.epub"">ePub</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.mobi"">Mobi (Kindle)</a></li><li><a href=""http://http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />","Two metaphors for professors and course delivery, comparing North America and China","academia/research,china,Education,europe,MA thesis,open-education,p2pU,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/12/07/two-metaphors-for-professors-and-course-delivery/,"I have described the historical and contextual background for the Top Level Courses Project, and compared it with the MIT OpenCourseWare project using a typology based on four different purposes. I have also discussed the possible impact of the MIT OpenCourseWare project conceptualized as either a norm or a policy innovation. However, what about reversing the picture, and asking: what are the chances that the Top Level Courses Project could be a policy innovation that might inspire North America? Apart from the decentralized higher education system in North America, which probably makes a similar project led by the federal or even a state government an impossibility, there is another factor which makes it difficult to conceptualize the implementation of a similar system even within a single university.To explain this, and to illustrate what I believe to be a fundamental but little commented upon difference between the two university systems, I will propose two different metaphors for conceptualizing a professor, and the act of teaching a course: <em>The professor as an artist and the course as a masterpiece, or the professor as an artisan, and the course a piece of craftmanship.</em>What we today call the multiversity does not have one single historical lineage, but brings together a number of different traditions. However, academics have since the early universities in Bologna and Paris struggled to establish a respected profession, with limited entry, that was largely self-managing. William Clark (2006) describes the &ldquo;charismatic academics&rdquo; that emerged in the 18th Century, that cultivated their charisma by insisting on their professorial dignity and by gathering admirers of their lecturing and research achievements. This emergence is related to the development of a specific university model, as symbolized by Humboldt University in Germany, originally the University of Berlin, where professors were given &ldquo;Lehr und Lernfreiheit&rdquo;, or the freedom to teach and research (Kopetz 2002). This led to the idea of &ldquo;academic superstars&rdquo;, even though in the current research universities, the way to fame has changed from applauding students attending your lecture, to publishing in the most prestigious journals.If we think of this &ldquo;charismatic academic&rdquo; with a spark of genius as an artist, and their courses as master pieces, a number of things become clear. Although the patron of an artist would hope to see the artist deliver a string of masterpieces, one would never thoroughly examine a masterpiece to provide feedback on how next year&rsquo;s artwork could be &ldquo;even better&rdquo;. Even less would one want an artwork designed by committee. Thus a tenured professor in North America is usually free to teach more or less what he or she wants, and although there is a system of student evaluations, there is no rigorous quality improvement system. The same academics that willingly submit their research to review by their peers, will not accept anyone sitting in on their classes, to offer friendly advice at the end, and a course tends to be a personal achievement that disappears when an academic disappears, developed alone, and not shared with others.However, this is not the only historical model of a university. Husn (1991) introduced four different historical models of the university.<ul><li>The Humboldtian research university, where research and teaching interacted from the very beginning.</li><li>The British residential model, with close informal contact between students and professors</li><li>The French grandes coles, intellectually and socially elite institutions as part of a state-directed, meritocratic society, featuring only teaching and no research.</li><li>The Chicago model, with a strong focus on the liberal arts.</li></ul>If we look at the two first models listed, the Humboldtian research university, and the British residential model, they both focus on charismatic academics, and the idea that teaching did not need to be carefully planned to be successful, merely coming into contact with a great professor, and working with them in a form of apprenticeship, or mentor-mentee relationship, would be sufficient.The French model, on the other hand, was much more centralized, where professors were hired as civil servants who helped produce future bureaucrats and political leaders. This was a much more goal-oriented system, and it separated research from teaching. Because of cultural affiliations, the French system had a large impact on Russian higher education, which began the introduction of technical higher education in 1809 with creating copies of the grandes coles. This highly state-directed system also suited the Soviet Union, and was the inspiration for the system that would eventually be transmitted to China in the 1950&rsquo;s (as we have seen in chapter two) (Gouzevitch 1995).The significance of separating research from teaching is profound, because it implies a specific epistemological view. According to Hayhoe (2008, 29):<blockquote>Within Soviet Communism, knowledge was seen as encyclopaedic, embracing all of the subject matter developed over human history. Thus the major subject disciplines developed in 19th century Europe were preserved in the curricula of secondary and tertiary institutions.</blockquote>If you believe that knowledge is &ldquo;encyclopaedic&rdquo;, it is possible to centralize and organize the teaching of this knowledge in very standardized forms. The purpose of a university degree becomes to transmit a certain body of knowledge, and one can measure and improve the delivery mechanism. In the German system, education could be seen not as transmitting a body of knowledge, but as cultivating certain attitudes and modes of thought among the students, training them to think scientifically.Although these two models differ significantly in their view of epistemology, the act of delivering a course would still be entrusted to a single teacher. Distance universities offer a very different image of an academic, and the development of a course. At the Open University in the United Kingdom, whenever a new course needs to be developed, a committee is put together. This will typically consist of subject specialists, instructional designers, media specialists and web designers. The development of a new course typically takes several years. Once the course has been designed, it can then be offered to a large number of people (Bissell and Williams 2008).Above we suggested that in the traditional research university, a professor could be seen as an artist, producing masterpieces. The distance university mode of production suggests a very different metaphor, one of an artisan. An artisan is skilled at what he or she does, but it can be learnt. He or she may work alone or together with a group of people towards a well-defined goal. The most important aspect is that the final product is improvable, it can be tested and evaluated, and it can be improved upon.Just as not all courses in North America are developed following the untouchable masterpiece metaphor, academics in China certainly do not fully adhere to the artisan metaphor. However, there is a very different tradition for developing courses, and improving on these in concert with others. Some of this comes from a history of a very centralized curriculum, and a lack of academic freedom and professorial autonomy. But some of this humbleness and willingness to work together, and to improve, would surely be welcome in North America as well.Thus the Ministry of Education is intent on promoting teaching teams consisting of senior, mid-career and young academics, to promote knowledge transfer and the involvement of senior faculty in undergraduate education. Courses have often been developed over a twenty-year period, in some cases being handed from mentor to mentee. Courses also regularly undergo internal and external peer-review, and many of the informants spoke of the way this had allowed them to reflect on their teaching methods, and share good ideas with colleagues. That all seems like a very sensible approach, although one that would be very difficult to implement in a system still characterized by the image of artists and divine inspiration.However, it is possible that things will be changing at North American universities as well. Distance and online learning is already growing at a very high pace, not just at traditional open universities, but at all institutions of learning. Because of the technical requirements, and the mode of delivery, these courses often end up being produced much more collaboratively.This might have an impact on regular courses as well. James Bess (2000) has proposed that college teaching is so complex that its various roles cannot be expected to be filled by only one person. There are many different cognitive roles involved with developing and delivering a course, and Bess identified seven: content research, instructional design, instructional delivery, discussion leading, content/activity integration, assessment, and mentoring. Collaborative teams might be able to provide more comprehensive service to students than individual teachers. It would also mitigate the current &ldquo;intellectual and physical isolation of the faculty member as teacher&rdquo;, and the resulting &ldquo;paucity of opportunities for significant reward&rdquo; which Bess believes plagues the North American system (p. 2). In light of this perspective, perhaps North America could learn something from the Chinese Top Level Courses Project.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li>Download this thesis: <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">PDF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.doc"">DOC</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.odt"">ODT</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.rtf"">RTF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.epub"">ePub</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.mobi"">Mobi (Kindle)</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />","Muvaffak Gozaydin => This is a great thesis.Everyone has to read and digest it..

I find it wonderful that we can now virtually travel around the world, ""peeking"" into classrooms, and learning from each other. This idea of transparency is one of the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/09/17/categorizing-oer-based-on-four-purposes/"">four purposes of OERs</a>, and I have tried to illustrate it through my little <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRbWXKnxB2c"">YouTube mashup</a> of lecture videos in many languages.During <a href=""http://discover.library.utoronto.ca/open-access-week/open-access-events"">Open Access Week 2010</a>, I gave a presentation at both the Scarborough and Missisauga campuses of University of Toronto entitled: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/global-open-educational-resources-and-the-university-of-toronto-as-a-multicultural-institution"">Global Open Educational Resources and the University of Toronto as a Multicultural Institution</a>, where I discussed how students with many different mother tongues could relate to these resources, both as users and producers. I later had a chance to visit the <a href=""http://www.uwcad.it/"">United World College of the Adriatic</a>, my old high school. UWCAD is an international school in Italy, with young people from more than 70 countries who come together to pursue excellence in studies, and promote international understanding. There, I was invited to give a version of this talk, called <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/oer-for-multicultural-uwc-2010"">Multilingual Open Educational Resources for a Multilingual and Multicultural UWC</a> to a full assembly of 180 students, teachers (including many of my old teachers), and staff.For various reasons, none of these talks were recorded, which is unfortunate. I hope I&#039;ll get a chance in the future to give a similar talk, which I can record and share online, but in the meantime, I thought I&#039;d try to blog around some of my slides, to share some of my ideas.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.002.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-785"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.002"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.002.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>So this was my ""proof"" that I did indeed attend his school, it&#039;s one of the pictures from the yearbook, taken ten years ago. You see me in the back row, and the woman in the centre of the front row was my Italian teacher, Cristina Leban, who was one of the most inspiring teachers I have ever had. The <a href=""http://www.uwc.org/"">UWC system</a> is quite interesting, it was started by a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Hahn"">Kurt Hahn</a>, a German who wanted to make sure that something like the World War II never happen again.His idea was to bring together young people from around the world, perhaps some of which would become future leaders, and engage them in a program of scholastic effort, sports, creative activities, and service to the community. A program so intense that the students, who only had each other - far from their own country, language and family - would form life-long bonds, and would not go to war against each other. I could write a lot about my time in Duino, Italy - it was an absolutely amazing time for me, and I think it was an important contributor to me becoming who I am, although I&#039;ll never know how much it changed me.Having this chance to go back there, and engage with the students who are now going through what I did ten years ago, was a wonderful experience. I must also thank the headmaster, whom I met this summer, during my ten year anniversary visit to Duino. When I told him about my ideas, he said: ""Why don&#039;t you come back during the school year, and tell this to the students - we&#039;d much rather have these kinds of initiatives come from them, rather than be initiated from the top."" I was very impressed by this attitude.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.003.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-808"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.003"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.003.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>I began by providing some examples of the incredible richness of OERs and other open resources that exist in the world. The fun change from when I usually give these presentations, was that there was probably at least one person in the audience who understood the language of every single example I gave. I won&#039;t repeat this here, but my 2009 presentation about <a href=""http://142.150.98.64/OISE/20090312-100421-1/rnh.htm"">OER around the world</a> is a good intro.I also talked about the concept of openness, Creative Commons licensing, the importance of not only using an open license, but also using open (editable) file formats to enable reuse to happen. You can see this portion of the talk in the <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/oer-and-p2pu"">talk I gave in New Delhi</a> about openness and P2PU.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.056.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-787"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.056"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.056.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>After having introduced the fact that there is such a wealth of open resources in all languages, and created some awareness about the importance (and potential) of openness, I began to tie this together with the multicultural character of the UWCAD. I told them about a class that I tutored at the University of Toronto. Just like the UWCAD students, my Toronto students were incredibly diverse, the only difference being that many of them had grown up in Toronto, whereas the Duino students all arrived directly from all their respective countries.In this Toronto class on <a href=""http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~chan/istb01/"">International Studies &amp; International Communications</a>, I tried to take advantage of this rich diversity in a number of ways. Here is a description of what I did, from an unpublished paper I have written:<blockquote>During the second lab session, I wanted to give the students a feel for how the web had developed during the last decade. We discussed a number of different aspects that had changed, and I then asked the students in groups of two to use the Internet Archive WayBackMachine to choose a website to examine. The WayBackMachine periodically archives the entire web, and allows you to view snapshots of websites as they looked last year, or 10 years ago. I asked them to choose a large website that was likely to have been around 8-10 years ago, and compare todays version with the archived version. Since many students with the same language sat together, I said that they were welcome to choose a website in their own language.One unexpected outcome of this was that several groups of Chinese and Korean students reported that on the archived pages there were just boxes or question marks instead of text. I told them that this was because at the time the pages had been written, there was no universal Unicode standard, and that they would have to manually select the character set for the page from the browser&rsquo;s menu. This led to an interesting discussion about how support for multilingual computing had developed, and the possible impact this could have had on the development of technology in different countries.As our class proceeded, I often pulled in international examples from my own experience, and encouraged students to do the same. We had an interesting discussion about different ways of mapping the world, which began with my displaying a Chinese world map -- where China is in the middle of the world, and the American continent is on the right side -- and continued with students finding other national examples of maps, and discussing how it might change people&rsquo;s perception of the world to be used to seeing maps that present the world from a certain perspective. On another occasion, I showed examples of Chinese webpage design, where the frontpage is often crammed with links. We discussed how web aesthetics might be different in China and in the West, and whether this was likely to converge (given the number of large American websites like Facebook and Youtube which have been copied whole-sale into Chinese versions), or diverge further.Finally, I showed them examples of government webpages from Indonesia that used Flash, and how that might impact usability in a country where most computers are not very powerful. These discussions all continued in our online discussion fora, which gave some of the students that were not active in class, a chance to contribute as well.</blockquote>However, the real turning point for me came during their final project:<blockquote>...the students chose a country and a topic (for example e-Health in Sudan or e-Democracy in India), and worked in pairs to develop a project proposal to the Canadian International Development Agency. They first had to hand in a draft, and then develop a finished proposal in the form of a website made with DreamWeaver. We emphasized the need for in-depth research, both to establish the needs analysis, and to prove that their proposed solution had a high likelihood of success. Given that the students in the class came from different fields of study, and many did not have experience with writing major papers, I spent significant time on discussing how to do research, what sources qualify as &ldquo;reliable&rdquo;, and the difference between peer-review and non-peer review.</blockquote>A group of two students came to talk to me about their project. They were both international students from China, who had come to Canada to study, and were now in their fourth and last year. They wanted to do research on tuberculosis in Inner Mongolia. I said, ""Great. I am assuming that you will want to include Chinese-language sources in your research?&rdquo;<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.057.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-788"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.057"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.057.jpg"" alt=""Are we allowed to do that?"" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>Yes, they were shocked to hear that they were ""allowed"" to use sources in Chinese. I specified that I wanted academic sources, not blogs or newspapers (I had previously spent an hour going through reliability of sources, peer-review and grey literature, etc), and their second question was: ""How can we find that?"". Although they had been at University of Toronto for four years, nobody had told them that the university subscribes to a database with 9.000 Chinese journals in full-text.In the end, they turned in one of the best projects in the class, citing both English and Chinese sources, and I began thinking more in-depth about the importance of encouraging students to include material in their mother tongue when doing research.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.058.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-789"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.058"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.058.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>After this experience, I became very interested in the idea of encouraging undergraduate students to include resources in their own languages during their research projects, and I went looking for interesting case studies, research on teachers&#039; attitudes to students doing this, resource guides on how bilingual students can be more effectively supported in the classroom... And I found almost nothing. There is a wealth of information about multiliteracy in kindergarten and primary school (see <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080402232906/http://www.ascd.org/authors/ed_lead/el200509_cummins.html"">this wonderful project in Toronto</a>), but for universities, there was almost nothing. Even when I wrote to a number of the central people in the field, I was told that it was a great area to research, but that they unfortunately could not help me.During my research, I came across a framework by Ruiz (1984), cited in a book by Jim Cummins, which intuitively made a lot of sense to me. He distinguished between seeing bilingualism as a problem, a right or a resource. Below is the section from Jim Cummins&#039; book that explains this concept (from ""<a href=""http://books.google.ca/books?id=fM4KdFOicGcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"">Language, power, and pedagogy: bilingual children in the crossfire</a>""):<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-28-at-12.53.03-AM.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-812"" title=""Screen shot 2010-11-28 at 12.53.03 AM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-28-at-12.53.03-AM.png"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""334"" /></a>So how can our universities and colleges treat students&#039; own languages as a resource?<a href=""http://books.google.ca/books?id=fM4KdFOicGcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false""></a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.059.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-790"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.059"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.059.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>Can open resources help with this? Well, in the case of University of Toronto, I argued that students should be encouraged to include resources in their mother tongues when doing research for papers (and indeed other languages that they might happen to speak), and the existence of Open Access journals can play an important role here - because not every university can afford to subscribe to databases of foreign journals. Luckily there is a wide range of Open Access journals available in most languages, below you see an overview of languages at the <a href=""http://www.doaj.org/"">Directory of Open Access Journals</a>. The first country listed is the US, but after that comes Brazil, and among the top countries, there is both Spain, India, Germany, Turkey and Italy - many of these journals are in languages other than English. Open repositories at universities, as listed for example at <a href=""http://roar.eprints.org/"">Registry of Open Access Repositories</a>, can also be a great way of finding academic publications in other languages.<a href=""http://books.google.ca/books?id=fM4KdFOicGcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false""></a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.061.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-792"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.061"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.061.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>But my primary concern at the United World College was not primarily research and open journals. Rather, it was the realization that <a href=""http://www.ibo.org/"">the International Baccalaureate</a>, which is taught at the school, is very Western-centric. When I arrived at the school, I thought it was very different from anything that I had ever experienced, and I think most students, including the Italian ones, felt the same. So I always thought of the school as kind of an ""airport"" - where everyone belongs or are strangers to the same degree. But when I later traveled to China, I began to realize that for some people, coming to the school had been a much larger transition than for others.I remember being very disappointed when I found out that the history curriculum only covered European history, and although the extra-curricular life at the school was incredibly rich with ""multicultural interactions"", I believe that life in the classroom was characterized by seeing ""language as a problem"" - bilingualism as a challenge to be overcome (by improving your English), not as a rich resource. I believe the curriculum in the school is in many ways quite disconnected from the various educational and cultural backgrounds that people come from, and while this is certainly not the main cause for a large percentage of the students choosing to continue their studies in anglophone countries, most would probably find continuing in a Western anglophone educational system, easier than returning to their home universities.I made the example of a student who after two years at the school might now know how to say ""marginal return of investment"" in Lithuanian (of course, after the lecture, a student came up to me and told me exactly how to say marginal rate of return in Lithuanian!)... Imagine if a Chinese student was attending a class on World War II - certainly taught by excellent teachers, but also certainly giving the Western perspective of a war that began by Germany invading Poland in 1939, and mainly taking place in Europe, except for Pearl Harbour, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I know this, because this is exactly what I learnt, when I took History Higher in Duino, ten years ago.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.060.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-791"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.060"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.060.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>Imagine that this Chinese student could go back to her dorm, and  look up a course on the World War II from East China Normal University,  and listen to a lecture in Chinese, from the Chinese perspective  (picture above is an existing open course on WWII in Chinese). She learns all the terminology in Chinese, as well as in  English, and personally gains an alternative view of the history of the war, for example <a href=""http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E6%AC%A1%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E5%A4%A7%E6%88%98#.E4.B8.AD.E5.9C.8B.E5.8F.8A.E5.A4.AA.E5.B9.B3.E6.B4.8B.E6.88.B0.E5.A0.B4"">that it began in 1937 with Japan&#039;s invasion of China</a>.This would also help the student connect what she was learning at the college better with what she had already learned in school, and through her growing up in China. But ideally, she could then bring this perspective into the classroom on the next day, thus making the class a richer experience for everyone, and turning ""language as a problem"" into ""language as a resource"".Right now, if you only compared the inside of the classroom of a United World College, with the inside of a classroom of a prestigious IB school in Toronto, the only difference might be that many of the students in Italy have problems with English - a deficiency model. Wouldn&#039;t it be great if the inside of the classroom was enriched because of all of these international perspectives, and language was seen as a strength and a source of richness?<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.062.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-793"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.062"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.062.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>However, I didn&#039;t come to Italy just to talk about how students could use the OER that exists out there. I wanted to talk about how they could become producers. In English, there is a huge variety of resources on almost any topic. Wikipedia is a good example, the English version seems to many to be nearly ""complete"". Certainly, there are many niche topics that are still not well enough covered (like Indonesian poets), and there are probably articles that could be considerably improved, but much of the ""low-hanging fruit"" is gone. If a student goes to a topic, they are likely to find a ten-page long article, with many citations. Only someone with a lot of confidence and expertise would be likely to feel comfortable adding to this article. This might be part of the reason why there has been a decrease in participation on the English Wikipedia.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.063.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-794"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.063"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.063.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>However, this is not the case in many other languages. For example, the <a href=""http://hi.wikipedia.org"">Wikipedia in Hindi</a>, a language spoken by 600 million people, still has only three sentences <a href=""http://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%89%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%87"">about Norway</a> (roughly: Norway is a country in Europe, it&#039;s capital is Oslo, it&#039;s main and official language is Norwegian). And similarly, above, you see the article <a href=""http://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F"">about Trieste</a> (the nearest big city to Duino) in Hindi. This is an obviously example of an area where a Hindi-speaking student could sit down and right away add several paragraphs of text. This does not only pertain to Hindi, but to many languages, some which are big in the real world, but small on the Internet, like Hindi, and others that are small in both spheres, like <a href=""http://ss.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likhasi_Lelikhulu"">Siswati</a>.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.064.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-795"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.064"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.064.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>There are many opportunities to make a contribution - editing Wikipedia; using <a href=""http://universalsubtitles.org/"">Universal Subtitles</a>, a tool developed by Mozilla to enable you to subtitle a movie on any website in the world, to subtitle educational videos; translating existing open educational resources, etc.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.065.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-796"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.065"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.065.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>My room mate, who happens to be an ex-UWCer from Hong Kong, is currently studying psychology in Toronto. She decided to <a href=""http://reganmian.net/sharon.to/"">start a blog</a> about her studies for two reasons. Firstly, she felt that she lacked the ability to communicate in Chinese about her subject of study, which was a real problem, since she hopes to practice in Hong Kong in the future. She also wanted to share with students in mainland China some of the knowledge she had gained through the opportunity of studying at the University of Toronto.Similarly, I suggested to the students that they could begin blogging about their subjects, in their own languages. Or even about the fantastic cultural excursions that the school organizes, to cathedrals in Firenze and Bologna - imagine a blog in Mongolian, or Korean, with pictures of great arches, and explanations of the historical significance.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.066.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-797"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.066"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.066.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>I&#039;ve often given talks about OER, and in addition to informing people of what is out there, I also hope to encourage them to change their daily practice - to begin to use new resources, perhaps, or even to create resources, share their existing work, <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">join P2PU</a> and propose a course, etc. It&#039;s very difficult to know what will be the outcome, and often I think of it more as sowing a seed, which can be nurtured with more exposure, discussions, and thinking - it might not lead to immediate action, but it still has an impact. However, in this case, I was really hoping to create some real change. And since I had been a student at this school myself, and knew more about how it operated, and how engaged and committed the students are, I made some concrete suggestions for things they could do.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.067.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-798"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.067"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.067.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>In addition to the regular subjects, the IB curriculum includes something called CAS - Creativity, Action and Service. Every student has to participate in one creative activity, one sport or athletic activity, and one social service each week. These are supervised by teachers, and a huge variety of them are offered. When I went to the school, I did basketball and kayaking, I ran the weekly Focus seminars on foreign policy, and contributed to the school newspaper, and I helped distribute food to homeless people, and took a Red Cross course and helped out at a transport ambulance. My idea here was to create a new creative activity centered around the production of open resources in different languages. This is partly because I know that the students are incredibly busy at the school, and if they could be able to block off one or two hours each week for this activity, they would be much more likely to do it.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.068.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-799"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.068"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.068.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>Another requirement of the IB is to write an Extended Essay. This is almost like an undergraduate honor&#039;s thesis, where a student chooses one topic, works with a supervisor over six months, does research and writes it up. Some of these papers turn out to be very interesting, both because the students at this school are amazing, and because they often do research in their home countries over the holidays, and write about topics that you might not find well covered elsewhere in the literature (in English). I did my essay about a Somali immigrant association in Trieste, and tried to answer whether a monoethnic immigrant association promoted or hindered the integration of its members. My analysis was of course not comparable to that of someone who has studied sociology for years, but I might have been the only one ever to have written about that specific organization, so I would argue that my study still has some value to the world. Certainly enough to warrant it not sitting on my shelf.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.069.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-800"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.069"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.069.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>My best example of how important it is to make student papers available comes from when I was researching the Indonesian community library movement for my <a href=""http://eprints.rclis.org/14659/"">BA thesis</a>. This was a very large phenomenon in Indonesia, but I could not find a single academic paper written about it. Finally, someone I knew at the Ministry of Education told me that an Indonesian undergraduate had emailed her and asked for info about the program because she was writing her BA Thesis about it. I got the student&#039;s email, and wrote to her. She wrote back, and enclosed a soft copy of her finished thesis. It was great - 120 pages, several case studies, full transcripts of interviews, bibliography of works I could not have found without access to Indonesian libraries.At this point, it was the only academic paper about the Indonesian community libraries existing in the world (that I knew about). So I thought - how is it that the only way I can get access to this, is through a friend of a friend? So I emailed her back, and said: Can I please get permission to post this online? She was skeptical, saying that it was only an undergraduate thesis, she had only written it to be able to graduate, it wasn&#039;t all that good, etc. But finally she gave me permission, and <a href=""http://eprints.rclis.org/cgi/users/home?screen=EPrint%3A%3AView%3A%3AOwner&amp;eprintid=11739&amp;_action_null.x=7&amp;_action_null.y=16&amp;_action_null=View+Item"">I posted it</a> on E-LIS, a repository for library research.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.070.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-801"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.070"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.070.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>So far, the thesis has been downloaded more than two thousand times! And most of those downloads come from Indonesia. When I told her that, she got excited, and said that she would ask all of her classmates to upload their theses as well!So my concrete suggestion was for the school to set up a repository where students who agreed, could post their Extended Essays. This would be a wonderful way of showcasing the amazing work that happens at the school, and I would certainly be very interested in subscribing to an RSS feed that displayed the abstracts of new student research papers!Interestingly, teachers in attendance broke in, and told me that this was impossible, because the IB holds the copyright to the students&#039; work. I thought this was very unreasonable, and was preparing to publicize this overreach, but a few days later I heard that they had checked with the IB, and in fact, it only required a non-exclusive license to the work, and that the students were free to do what they wanted with the theses. So that&#039;s a great clarification to come out of the talk.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.072.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-803"" title=""OER for multicultural UWC 2010.072"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/OER-for-multicultural-UWC-2010.072.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""341"" /></a>At the time I gave the talk, I was also scheduled to attend my first TED Talks. <a href=""http://tedxibyork.com/"">TEDxIBYORK</a> was an event organized by an IB school in Toronto. They had invited student speakers from IB schools in the US and Canada who spent one day competing against each other for the best presentation, and the second day, they had a variety of ","The power of models and examples, understanding the role of the Top Level Courses Project in China","academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,open-education,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/12/08/the-power-of-models-and-examples-understanding-the-role-of-the-top-level-courses-project-in-china/,"In <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/12/07/two-metaphors-for-professors-and-course-delivery"">the previous section</a>, I discussed different European models of the university, showing the role of teaching and research in the German university, which would become the inspiration for the North American research university, and the French university, which would inspire the Soviet Union, and in time China. I also showed how the role of the professor at traditional research universities and newer distance universities could be seen as an artist or an artisan. However, there are also important differences between the history of educational thought in China, and the West, which might have had an influence on the development of the Top Level Courses Project.One of the important differences between education in China, and the West, was the much larger emphasis on the written word in China. While Clark (2006) spends much time discussing the oral traditions in the European medieval universities, China had already instituted the first anonymous written exams much earlier (Thomas H. C. Lee 2000). Students had access to a wealth of earlier writings, and were expected to imitate these as a form of learning. Reed (1992) talks about modelling as a pedagogical technique in China, whether in the case of art students carefully copying the master&rsquo;s strokes, or scholars copying the Confucian classics. She believes that &ldquo;modelling is more than mere imitation, as we so often tend to view it in the West; rather, it is a process that should lead to inner transformation&rdquo; (ibid, 78).The Communist Party frequently chose outstanding people to act as exemplars for the nation, the most famous being the soldier Lei Feng, whose post-humously published diaries were widely read and discussed. Lei Feng could be seen as a &ldquo;proletarianized version of earlier Confucian prototypes&rdquo;, cultivating the same virtues, loyalty, filial piety, self-cultivation, modesty, frugality, diligence and benevolence, as those of his Confucian forebearers (Reed 1998, 360).It might be a stretch to see the current-day Top Level Courses professors as moral examples, and there is no mention in the official government policies about patriotism, selflessness, or sacrifice. Rather, it is a much more utilitarian focus on promoting excellent courses. However, the use of models might still be relevant, when discussing different approaches to teaching and the role of teachers. Stevenson and Stigler (1992, 167-168) have surveyed teacher attitudes in the US and China, and found significant differences related to building on a common core, versus having to invent everything from scratch.In Asia, the ideal teacher is a skilled performer. As with the actor or musician, the substance of the curriculum becomes the script or the score; the goal is to perform the role or piece as effectively and creatively as possible. Rather than executing the curriculum as a mere routine, the skilled teacher strives to perfect the presentation of each lesson. She uses the teaching techniques she has learned and imposes her own interpretation on these techniques in a manner that she thinks will interest and motivate her pupils.In America, teachers are judged to be successful when they are innovative, inventive and original. Skill presentation of a standard lesson is not sufficient and may even be disparaged as indicating a lack of innovative talent. It is as if American teachers were expected to write their own play or create their own concerto day after day and then perform it with expertise and finesse. These two models, the skilled performer and the innovator, have very different value in the East and West.Stevenson and Stigler are discussing the attitudes of K-12 teachers, but it is possible that there are similar differences in attitude among university professors, where the requirement to be unique and independent is much stronger in North America.In the two sections above, I have shown how the Top Level Courses Project exists in a higher education system that owes more to the French centralized teaching-focused system than the German research-university model that influenced North American universities so profoundly. It also exists in a culture where models and examples, and building on the work of others &ndash;also in teaching &ndash;have a long history. These are factors that might make it difficult to implement a similar program in North America, but also factors that make us understand and appreciate the Chinese system much better, and could inspire us to rethink university teaching in North America.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li>Download this thesis: <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">PDF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.doc"">DOC</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.odt"">ODT</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.rtf"">RTF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.epub"">ePub</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.mobi"">Mobi (Kindle)</a></li><li><a href=""http://http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",The Chinese Top Level Courses Project: Conclusion and directions for further research,"academia/research,china,Education,MA thesis,open-education,p2pU,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/12/09/the-chinese-top-level-courses-project-conclusion-and-directions-for-further-research/,"In this thesis, I set out to understand how the Top Level Courses Project was organized, and how it came to be. I wanted to compare it with MIT OpenCourseWare, and understand whether MIT&rsquo;s project had influenced the development of the Top Level Courses Project in any way. I also discussed whether the spread of the OpenCourseWare concept could be seen as a sign of growing isomorphism in values among institutions of higher education in the world, and I proposed the counter-theory that what was happening was a borrowing of ideas or concepts in name only, that were implemented in quite different ways.In chapter three, I showed how concepts of course teams, and improvable courses developed by groups over many years arose, and how the tradition of course evaluations followed immediately after the centralized curriculum began to be opened up. This came together with the unprecedented expansion of Chinese higher education in the last 15 years, and the strong focus on investing in excellent examples &ndash; first universities, then disciplines, and finally courses &ndash; chosen through peer-review. Taken together with the focus on IT in education, this made the creation of the Top Level Courses Project a natural next step, but it is possible that some of the impetus came from knowledge of the MIT project.I have described in detail how the project is organized, and how it is experienced by university administrators and participating professors. I used this in chapter six to show that the project was fundamentally different from MIT&rsquo;s OpenCourseWare, although there were a few areas that overlapped. I discussed the differences between the two projects using the framework of the four purposes, suggested in chapter two, as well as by conceptualizing MIT OpenCourseWare as a norm, and as a policy innovation.I then showed how the Top Level Courses Project has been fundamentally misunderstood in the West as a direct continuation of the MIT model, and used theories from policy borrowing, and case studies from other Asian countries, to show how this could have happened. Finally, in the conclusion, I proposed that the history of Chinese higher education discussed in chapter two has led to a model of course development that is fundamentally different from the North American model, as a reason why this project could not easily be transferred to a North American university, but also suggest that this situations might be changing.<strong>Directions for future research</strong>This thesis has given a detailed account of how the Top Level Courses Project is organized, and what purposes it is intended to serve. I have not made any attempt to evaluate whether the project is successful in attaining any of these goals. Although there have been criticisms of the project raised in the Chinese literature, and some evaluation performed, there is a great need for rigorously designed studies designed to test some of the central assumptions. I believe that the four purposes introduced in chapter two could help in that process. As it is, several papers have attempted to evaluate the project without first specifying which purpose it believed the program served.One could design an experiment to measure the impact of teachers who go through the process of having their courses selected as Top Level Courses, and the entire department. Do they become better teachers? Do the courses improve? Does it have an inspirational effect on the entire department? Further, one could look at professors at other institutions who consult material from courses similar to their own. Does it inspire them to improve their own courses, or do they acquire new ideas and content that they can use in their teaching?It is also possible to look at student use of the resources, and whether they are able to learn effectively, but it should be kept in mind that this was never one of the main purposes of the project (although it seems to have become slightly more prioritized as the project develops).There is also a wide-open space for comparative educators and higher education specialists within the open education research sphere. Currently, most of the research is conducted by educational technologists, but there are many very fruitful venues for comparative and historical studies. This thesis has been an attempt at using Chinese higher education history and current context to explain the development of an Open Educational Resources project that ended up very differently from the global OpenCourseWare model.Another approach would be to use these open materials as data in a comparative curriculum project. There are a few examples of this from China, where China Open Resources for Education facilitated 148 comparative studies comparing MIT curriculum with the curriculum at Chinese universities (CORE 2007).Two specific examples are Li et al. (2007), who conducted a narrow study of 14 Top Level biology courses and 22 MIT OpenCourseWare biology courses, and found that Top Level Courses are largely based on unidirectional classroom instruction, whereas MIT courses emphasize student interaction. And Liu Kefu (2006) used OpenCourseWare to do a comparative study of classics courses in the United States. Given the wide variety of materials available, this could fruitfully be extended to other areas.<hr />The quotes in this text is from the MA Thesis ""The Chinese National Top Level Courses Project: Using Open Educational Resources to Promote Quality in Undergraduate Teaching"" by Stian Hklev, University of Toronto 2010.<ul><li>Download this thesis: <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.pdf"">PDF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.doc"">DOC</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.odt"">ODT</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Haklev_Stian_201009_MA_thesis.rtf"">RTF </a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.epub"">ePub</a> <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/top-level-courses.mobi"">Mobi (Kindle)</a></li><li><a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">Central page collecting all blog posts, many different download formats, and supplementary material</a></li></ul><hr />",P2PU in 24 different languages!,"academia/research,Education,languages,open-education,p2pU,plenk2010,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/12/09/p2pu-in-24-different-languages/,"<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/actualite.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-864"" title=""actualite"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/actualite.jpg"" alt="""" width=""433"" height=""228"" /></a>So far, P2PU has offered courses in English and Portuguese, and we have a growing Spanish community that is hoping to launch several Spanish courses in January.

It&#039;s always exciting to check Google Analytics and see how people are finding out about P2PU.I wanted to put together a list of all the languages that P2PU has been mentioned in. Some of these languages have numerous mentions, blogposts and newspaper articles, others just have one small article. However, all the articles are written by people outside of the core team, and only include articles, not tweets (of which there would have been more). In total, I came to 24 languages!

Not only because I believe it&#039;s the only ethical thing to do &ndash; when so many people in China have gone out of their way to help me in my research (see <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/03/07/a-fair-trade-logo-for-academic-research/"">my thoughts about this</a>), but also because I want my thesis to be a part of the scholarly discourse in China.Almost nobody in the West have even heard about this project, so they are not in a position to judge the veracity of most of what I present. The real test is having the people who research and work with the project on a daily basis read my thesis - if I have gotten things wrong, I hope they will let me know.Unfortunately, I have to pay for the translation out of my own pocket, and I had to wait until I could afford it. I spent quite a while looking for someone who were willing to do it for the little money I could offer, but still do a good job - I was offering about 1/3 of the going price among professional translation agencies.Through a friend at South China Normal University, I was extremely lucky to find someone who was not only deeply immersed in the literature on open education, but was also a very solid translator. He has already translated the first chapter, and I am very impressed by the fidelity to the original, and the naturalness of the language. When the whole thesis has been translated, I hope to work with some Chinese students to extract an article or two, to submit to Chinese academic journals.I am eager to get the translation done, and be able to send it out to all my contacts in China. But it occurred to me that there is no reason to wait until I have the complete translation, before I begin sharing it. I serialized my thesis in English on this blog, but that was when the thesis was already done. In this case, I thought I&#039;d serialize the Chinese translation as each piece emerges from translation.I also thought that it would be nice to have a place to showcase my other Chinese-language resources, for example the Chinese presentations I have done. So I set up a <a href=""http://reganmian.net/boke"">Chinese blog</a>, and began by posting the chapter that has already been translated.I am very curious about the reaction - I sent the link to the English thesis to all my contacts in China, and although I received much appreciation, I did not receive a single substantive comment on the contents of my thesis, which makes me think that many did not end up reading it. (I don&#039;t blame them - if you send me a 100-page academic thesis in Chinese, I have to be very motivated to read it). It will be interesting to see if the availability of the Chinese version changes this.Stian","Stian Håklev => Hi Alan,thanks a lot for chiming in. Yes it will be interesting to see if there is more feedback, however I must note that I have actually received very little feedback on the English one as well. It&#039;s been out for about two months, and had more than 1600 PDF downloads. The serialization has been a success in terms of people reading it through their feedreaders (anecdotally I know of several people who have been following it), as well as other sites picking up on individual topics and linking to them (Open Education News, Stephen Downes, etc), bringing more traffic, and proof of interest. I&#039;ve heard from a number of people who gave positive feedback, saying they had read it, and found parts of it interesting - however, I have not had almost anyone actually engage with the contents, whether criticizing it or building upon it. This might happen in the future of course, through people citing it and building on it in the inevitably slow academic discourse.I wrote a bit about this concept of criticizing others in a previous blog post (http://reganmian.net/blog/2009/06/09/on-critically-engaging-with-other-peoples-writing/).Another issue is that I&#039;ve somehow never been able to generate much comments on this blog. I know I have readers - people sometimes tell me, I get the statistics, and sometimes my articles are linked to in other blogs, or tweeted. But I almost never get any comments. I&#039;m not quite sure why. It&#039;s certainly a big motivator for writing - one comment is worth a thousand anonymous hits of people who found you through Google, and quickly click away. (Whether I am able to garner some interest on the Chinese blog, will also probably determine to what extent I spend time writing original pieces, and to what extent it turns into simply an online name card, and list of my talks/articles in Chinese).Stian. Alan Webb => Hi Stian!I hope you get many more comments from your translated edition and good of you to take that on at your own expense!Just a thought (though you most likely have already considered this); I wonder if cultural norms about criticism and giving constructive feedback may be effecting the inclination of any of your Chinese readers to comment on your work.  I am sure you are well aware of the norms I am talking about; how  culturally uncomfortable it can be for a Chinese person to directly criticise another person.  I have often found that if I want frank feedback from Chinese friends I have to provide a go-between mechanism for them to provide it indirectly- through a trusted, mutual friend, through an anonymous submission process, through very direct multiple-choice option questions, etc.  Even then, the negative feedback I end up getting is most often couched in positive ways and has to be read out from between the lines.  Have you provided some kind of mechanism for receiving indirect feedback?Again, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve had more experience with this than me, just an off-the-top-of-my-head reaction to your comment about lack of feedback so far!Best,Alan.

Instead of the traditional 开放式课程 (kaifangshi kecheng) - quite a literal translation of ""open courses / open courseware"", the new term being used is 公开课 (public / open courses).<em>A little linguistic aside: Here is what the <a href=""http://uhpress.wordpress.com/books-in-series/abc-chinese-dictionary-series/"">ABC Chinese Dictionary</a> says about kaifang: ""1) come into bloom 2) lift a ban/etc. 3) open to traffic or public use; open to the world 4) be turned on, be in operation 5) hand over a government monopoly to private operations"". For gongkai: ""V. make public; make known to the public.

It can also be used about people to mean that they are liberal, even loose, or ""open minded"". It has traditionally been used for open in OER, open source, open courseware, etc. Seeing the dictionary definitions above, it is something that ""has been opened"" as a conscious act, by someone. Gongkai to me seems to reflect something that is ""public"", almost by its nature, where access to it is almost a right.</em>Either way, there is now a very strong public interest in these courses, with this new catchy name, and a number of website portals have been created, which feature the video lectures from Yale, Stanford, MIT, etc.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/cicistudy.png""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-883"" title=""cicistudy"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/cicistudy-300x199.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""199"" /></a>While browsing, I came across <a href=""http://cicistudy.com""><strong>CICIStudy</strong></a>, and found it to be a site with very clean design, and nice functionality. I was very curious as to who had started it, what their purpose was, etc., and sent an interview to the e-mail listed on their website asking for an interview - which they graciously granted.I found their take on the developing interest in open courses in China to be very interesting, and I wish them the best of luck in the future!<em>(The original interview was conducted in Chinese, and <a href=""http://reganmian.net/boke/2011/01/03/%e9%99%b6%e8%af%be%e5%85%88%e9%94%8b_%e9%87%87%e8%ae%bfcici/"">the full text is available</a>. I did the translation, and CICIStudy has not had a chance to review it for accuracy. Since the term gongkaike does not differentiate between OpenCourseWare and other open course projects, I have translated it as ""open courses"" below.)</em><hr /><strong>1. Who are you? What is your background? What kind of an organization is CICIStudy? Is it a part of a larger company, or a company that was just started for this purpose? Or are you just doing it as a group?</strong>Currently our group is not part of any company, and we have not created a company ourselves, everything is in the beginning phase. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that it is difficult for us to create an excellent service, the members of the group have backgrounds from large companies such as Microsoft, and are extremely familiar with web development, which guarantees that we are able to effectively develop CICIStudy.<strong>2. How did you first hear about, or get interested in open courses courses? Why do you think they are useful and important to Chinese students?</strong><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/mitocw.png""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-882"" title=""mitocw"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/mitocw-300x202.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""202"" /></a>At the beginning of 2010, I had only barely heard about open courses, and watched a few course recordings. I though it was great, but didn&rsquo;t pay that much attention. I had no idea that the phenomenon of open courses had grown so large in other countries. In April, I happened to watch a news report about open courses, and suddenly realized the importance of providing a local platform for these resources. That evening, I began to seek out resources, and plan the development of CICIStudy.Three days later, I began seriously planning and designing the site. After launching the site, I began to understand open courses more in depth. Whether these courses are transmitting knowledge, or spreading moral values, they touch people profoundly.So far, these courses have not been able to have a large impact on Chinese students &ndash;they might watch a lecture after they are finished repeating homework, going to class, and all the other activities of a university student.However, the courses are still very important &ndash;being able to provide access to wisdom for students who seek it is already of extraordinary value. And the real value created is not just limited to students &ndash; from the feedback we have received to the site, we know that 60 year olds are equally interested in the courses.<strong>3. What is the goal of CICIStudy? What kind of functionality do you provide?</strong>What CICIStudy wants to provide is a stream of information that contains condensed wisdom. The goal of the platform is for people to be able to very easily receive high quality education (unequal distribution of educational resources has always been a problem). At the same time, learners should be able to receive guidance and communicate with other learners, so that the learning becomes truly participatory, and not just limited to downloading and viewing.This means that for CICIStudy, how to enable everyone to learn more effectively becomes the key question, and the development of all features must be centred around this goal. Also, we are not at all restricted to only offering open course resources, even if open courses are currently the best, and most attractive resources available, which is why we chose to present them as the main feature.<strong>4. Lately, Chinese white-collar workers have taken an explosive interest in open courses, why? Open courses have existed since 2003, why is it only now that so many people in China became interested in them?</strong>I think it all began with some subtitling groups, which about half a year ago began to subtitle videos from Yale and other universities, on their own initiative. Since this had removed the language barrier that prevented Chinese net users from accessing the videos, and given the wide renown of the universities involved, this led to much interest, and extremely high download/view numbers from video sharing sites. This in turn led to the first newspaper article, which began a continuous stream of news coverage, only serving to increase the general interest in these videos.In 2003, these special conditions did not exist. The scale and reach of subtitling groups was still very small, and video sharing sites and community portals were also in the very beginning of their development trajectory. At that time, there wasn&rsquo;t the level of reflection around educational issues as there is today, and finally, the media was not as interested at that time, as they are today. All of these factors, as well as other direct and indirect factors, led the open course phenomenon to explode this year &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t random.<strong>5. There are other websites that do very similar things to you, for example NetEase Open Courses. What is special about your site, how can you compete with these other sites?</strong><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/wangyi.png""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-884"" title=""wangyi"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/wangyi-300x144.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""144"" /></a>The NetEase Open Courses site is a part of the NetEase video site. Currently, they are focusing on how to overcome the linguistic obstacles, by hiring translation agencies to subtitle videos. CICIStudy is more concerned about becoming a platform that enables learning. Displaying the videos to the users is fulfilling one step of sharing open resources, but it&rsquo;s not enough. It would be irresponsible to ignore the need for learner initiative and enthusiasm during the learning process.We hope that the platform will enable us to explore and research effective ways of enabling all students interested in acquiring more knowledge to do so effectively with rich communication and collaboration. On one hand, virtualizing the traditional classroom with it&rsquo;s socratic interactions provides an atmosphere of deep thought and reflection, on the other hand. On the other hand, utilizing the web&rsquo;s potential for rich media and immediacy enables us to amplify the advantages of traditional distance education.Currently, we are still very far from achieving our goal, but whether we will be successful or not, this kind of research is still very valuable.<strong>6. What is your business model? Will you let people pay for accessing courses in the future?</strong>Open Courses are based around Creative Commons licenses, and so far the materials I have seen all require sharing to be in a non-commercial situation. How to find an effective business model in such a situation is still a paradox. We would like to be able to consult with the rights owners to ease the situation a bit, so that we could keep the site running. Of course, if there were foundations or other organizations that could provide financial support, that would be of huge help, but currently we don&rsquo;t have any leads in this field.One thing that is certain, is that there will never be a situation where people need to pay to be able to access resources on our site, they will always be freely available to anyone who are interested. Even if we acquired materials that we owned the copyright to, we would not close off access &ndash; that would go against our initial principles.<strong>7. Foreign open courses use open licenses, so using them is not &ldquo;piracy&rdquo;. Is that important to you? How do you make sure that your website respects the requirements of these licenses?</strong>You are right, this is very important to us, we really hope that we are respecting the licenses properly. We show the CC logo and the fact that this resource is licensed under a CC-license on every video page, but there might still be some oversights.From my personal point of view, the understanding of CC licenses in China is still very weak. We are still in the phase of stressing the importance of copyright protection, and the concept of the creative commons has not gotten wide recognition yet. People have not yet reflected much about the meaning of knowledge sharing, and abuses of open licenses.<strong>8. What do you think about the Chinese National Top Level Courses Project? Are there excellent resources there as well? Will you consider including resources from Top Level Courses on your website in the future?</strong><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/jingpinke.png""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-881"" title=""jingpinke"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/jingpinke-300x202.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""202"" /></a>It&rsquo;s very difficult for me to give an accurate assessment of the Top Level Courses, since I have not reviewed these resources systematically, although I am sure that the courses contain many excellent resources. I have never participated in the production of Top Level Courses at university-level, but I helped out as a student in the production of video courses at my high school. The teachers who were delivering the video lectures would spend a lot of time preparing, beginning almost a month before the lecture took place, and they made sure to use multimedia appropriately.This left a deep impression on me, at that time I even created a Flash website as assist in the learning. The Top Level Courses Project probably also has a lot of really great websites that promote interaction. However, when I went to the main portal site, I only saw a point-based system for downloading resources, which limits the distribution of these resources.In the future, if the licensing problem gets resolved, I hope that we can put these resources on our website and make them available to all of our users. There are many great lecturers in China, and their Top Level Courses can be great for learning. It&rsquo;s a real shame that we are currently unable to share these courses.<strong>9. What is your future development plan for your platform, and group? New features, contents, services?</strong>The development of CICIStudy has already reached milestone number 3, and between the 10th and 15th of January, we will release new functionality to the site. This will include taking course notes, and rating these among users, collaborative translation, search functionality, better organization of the lecture videos, etc. We are currently exploring and researching better and richer ways of studying.<em>Thank you very much to CICIStudy for generously agreeing to this interview, and for providing Chinese learners with more opportunities.</em>","elin => Stumbled over your blog today by accident doing research for my BA thesis but being very interested in the education system of china I ended up staying here browsing way too long.

After lunch, I felt quite burnt out however, after taking quite detailed notes for two and a half day already. In addition, I had some very interesting conversations during lunch, and my head kept spinning around those ideas, rather than focusing on the current speakers, so the notes below are by no means complete. Luckily Doug Clow took <a href=""http://dougclow.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/lak11-tuesday-afternoon/"">notes from the afternoon sessions</a>.All in all, it was a really great conference - beautiful venue, lot&#039;s of opportunities to interact, and a ton of new ideas.

The first is the <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu"">MIT OpenCourseWare</a> approach (which has been replicated by universities across the US, and the world). Given that professors are already developing a set of materials to be used in their face-to-face teaching, let&#039;s grab these and upload to the web. The result is a curriculum, maybe some PowerPoints, sometimes lecture recordings, some quiz sheets, etc. From the perspective of self-learners, this is rarely enough material. Only a fraction of all OCW courses provide lecture recordings, and even if they do, most of the resources listed in the syllabus will be unavailable (books that cost $100s of dollars, articles that are only available through university libraries).The other approach is more common for distance universities which tend to develop much more of the material by themselves, using a more industrial approach to curriculum development (with teams of subject experts working with instructional designers, web and media specialists, etc). Because they have developed more of the material in-house, and for online presentation, they are able to share more coherent and accessible packages - <a href=""http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/"">OpenUniversity UK</a> is a great example of this. <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/ocw-scholar/"">MIT OCW Scholar</a> is an attempt at making a few selected OCW courses into more complete packages, with additional resources necessary for students to learn. Most of this is still generated by MIT, but they also link to some outside resources.Of course, there are also plenty of OER resources which do not take the shape of ""college-level 12-week courses"", from projects like <a href=""http://cnx.org"">Connexions</a>, an online authoring platform for educational modules, to <a href=""http://www.fhsst.org/"">Free High School Science Textbooks</a> in South Africa, and even resources that we often don&#039;t think of as OERs, such as <a href=""http://wikipedia.org"">Wikipedia</a>, and <a href=""http://www.doaj.org"">Directory of Open Access Journals</a>. However, for an independent self-learner, it can be very difficult to put together a sequence of learning by picking and choosing from these sites, especially in a subject that is not familiar.The one thing common to most of the approaches listed above, is that they focus on producing and sharing their own materials. In the case of many institutions, it&#039;s a point of pride that ""MIT videos"", ""Yale videos"", etc. are being watched by people around the world. They are branded products, sharing the ""excellence of the institution"" with the wider world. The predictable result is that we might have ten or twenty ""Economics 101"" courses, all skeletal and incomplete, all containing the material from only one institution. It might be much more beneficial to the world if a Yale professor spent his time improving, and adding to a course created by an MIT professor, instead of just putting out his own material - but that might not bring as much attention and publicity.This dilemma was one of the reasons why we started <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">Peer2Peer University</a>. Our model is basically based on three pillars. First, course organizers create course outlines that only link to resources that are freely (gratis) available on the web. These resources can be from OpenCourseWare collections, from open access journals, from Wikipedia articles, YouTube videos, newspaper articles, etc. These <a href=""http://p2pu.org/courses"">course outlines</a> are published on P2PU.org, and made available under an open license - anyone can access them, and begin learning by themselves, whether or not a course is running right then, or not. The second pillar is to create a community of learners around this course, which goes through the resources together, discuss the ideas, and support each others&#039; learning. The final pillar is recognition of learning and accreditation, which we are still experimenting with in several ways.I wrote my <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">MA thesis</a> about a large project for publishing open courses in China, which resulted in more than 12,000 courses being published by more than 700 universities. When I talked to groups of Chinese students and professors in the open education field, they often complained that the quality of these courses was not high enough, and that students would not be interested in visiting them. I encouraged them to think of these courses as resource collections, and curate curricula that were excellent - find a great video from this course, a great reading from that course, put it all together. I also suggested making this easier, when I was invited to give <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/ss-3362818"">a talk</a> to the Top Level Courses Resource Portal team, at the Higher Education Press.<strong>Saylor Foundation Free Education Initiative</strong><strong><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-2.46.49-PM.png""><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"" title=""Taylor logo"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-2.46.49-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""275"" height=""94"" /></a></strong>Today I came across the <a href=""http://www.saylor.org/"">Saylor Foundation Free Education Initiative</a>, and was extremely impressed. The Saylor Foundation was started by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Saylor"">Michael J. Saylor</a>, co-founder of a company called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroStrategy"">MicroStrategy</a> (apparently <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/05/24/260289/index.htm"">an interesting guy)</a>, and had <a href=""http://www.eri-nonprofit-salaries.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=NPO.Form990&amp;EIN=541933630&amp;Year=2011"">assets of around $14 million</a> in 2009. The <a href=""http://www.saylor.org/about/"">mission of the foundation</a> is to provide access to a free college-level education for all (they say that high school and post-graduate courses might be coming in the future). Their strategy for achieving this is:<blockquote>By developing, soliciting, and disseminating free online academic materials in a structured and intuitive format, we will be an alternative and a complement to mainstream education providers, especially for students who cannot take advantage of educational opportunities because they cannot afford them.</blockquote>They have identified the ten majors with the highest enrolments in the US:<ul><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/majors/biology/"">Biology</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/majors/business-administration/"">Business Administration</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/majors/chemistry/"">Chemistry</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/majors/computer-science/"">Computer Science</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/majors/economics/"">Economics</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/majors/english/"">English</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/majors/history/"">History</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/majors/mathematics/"">Mathematics</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/majors/mechanical-engineering/"">Mechanical Engineering</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/majors/political-science/"">Political Science</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/majors/psychology/"">Psychology</a></li></ul>And for each, they&#039;ve endeavoured to create a full compliment of courses. For example, the Economics major lists fourteen courses, seven in the core program, and seven electives. All but three of these are complete.<span style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;"">Core Program</span><ul><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ101/"">ECON101: Principles of Microeconomics</a> <a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(100%)</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ102/"">ECON102: Principles of Macroeconomics</a> <a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(100%)</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ103/"">ECON103/MA101: Single-Variable Calculus I</a> <a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(100%)</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ104/"">ECON104/MA121: Introduction to Statistics</a> <a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(0%)</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ201/"">ECON201: Intermediate Microeconomics</a> <a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(0%)</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ202/"">ECON202: Intermediate Macroeconomics</a> <a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(0%)</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ203/"">ECON203: Econometrics</a> <a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(100%)</a></li></ul><h3>Elective Courses</h3><ul><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/"">ECON301: History of Economic Ideas</a><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(100%)</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ302/"">ECON302: Money and Banking / Financial Economics</a><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(100%)</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ303/"">ECON303: Labor Economics</a><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(100%)</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ304/"">ECON304: Economic Development</a><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(100%)</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ305/"">ECON305: Public Finance</a><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(100%)</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ306/"">ECON306: Industrial Organization</a><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(100%)</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ307/"">ECON307: International Trade</a><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/saylor-foundation-status/"">(100%)</a></li></ul>What&#039;s unique about these courses is that they are curations of material freely available on the web, put together in a very well thought-out structure. For example, the course <a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/"">History of Economic Ideas</a> consists of five units. Each unit has a brief introduction, learning objectives, and a list of carefully selected resources. Here is the first unit:<strong>Unit 1: Ancient Economic Thought</strong><ul><li><strong>1.1 Political, Economic, and Social Thought in the Near East and Greece</strong></li><li><strong> </strong><strong>1.1.1 Ancient Egypt to Mesopotamia</strong></li><li><strong> </strong><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#"">Lecture: iTunesU: University of Wisconsin-Madison: Professor Charles Anderson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Political, Economic, and Social Thought: Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Ancient Israel&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#""></a><strong>1.1.2 Greece</strong></li><li><strong></strong><strong>1.1.2.1 Xenophon</strong></li><li><strong></strong><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#"">Reading: Project Gutenberg&rsquo;s version of Xenophon&rsquo;s The Economist</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#""></a><strong>1.1.2.2 Aristotle</strong></li><li><strong></strong><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#"">Reading: Project Gutenberg&rsquo;s version of Aristotle&rsquo;s A Treatise on Government</a></li><li><strong>1.2 China</strong></li><li><strong></strong><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#"">Reading: Wikipedia&rsquo;s version of Fan Li&rsquo;s &ldquo;Twelve Golden Rules and Safeguards&rdquo;</a></li><li><strong>1.3 India</strong></li><li><strong></strong><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#"">Reading: Fordham University&rsquo;s version of selections from Chanakya&rsquo;s Arthashastra</a></li></ul>As you can see, the foundation does not aim to produce all the material themselves, rather they link to resources from OpenCourseWare, Project Gutenberg, Wikipedia, and other sources (some of the math courses link to <a href=""http://www.khanacademy.org/"">Khan Academy videos</a>).I have to include another module from this course, the last one, about visionary thinkers and economic utopias:<ul><li><strong>5.1 Fictional Utopias</strong></li><li><strong>5.1.1 Sir Thomas More</strong><ul><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#"">Reading: Project Gutenberg&rsquo;s version of Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s Utopia and University of Wisconsin: J.P.Sommerville&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thomas More, Christian Humanism, Catholicism, and Utopia&rdquo;</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>5.1.2 Edward Bellamy</strong><ul><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#"">Reading: Project Gutenberg&rsquo;s version of Edward Bellamy&rsquo;s Looking Backwards, 2000-1887 and Bolling Green State University: Wayne Sneath&rsquo;s &ldquo;Edward Bellamy&rdquo;</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>5.1.3 Modern Discourse</strong><ul><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#"">Lecture: iTunesU: Walker Art Center: Stephen Duncombe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Utopia is no Place: the Art and Politics of Impossible Futures&rdquo;</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>5.2 Economic Experiments</strong></li><li><strong>5.2.1 The Shakers</strong><ul><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#"">Reading: The University of Virginia: Kathleen Hogan&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Shakers&rdquo;</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>5.2.2 The Qarmatians</strong><ul><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#"">Reading: Bahrain Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;al-Qaramita&rdquo;</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>5.2.3 The Anarcho-Syndicalists</strong><ul><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#"">Reading: Anarchosyndicalism.net&rsquo;s &ldquo;Anarcho-Syndicalist FAQ&rdquo;</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>5.2.4 Marxists</strong><ul><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#"">Reading: Marxists.org&rsquo;s Rosa Luxemburg&rsquo;s The Russian Revolution, Chapter Six</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>5.3 Buddhist Economics</strong><ul><li><a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ301/#"">Reading: The Centre for Bhutan Studies&rsquo; &ldquo;Gross National Happiness&rdquo;</a></li></ul></li></ul>Really exciting stuff - I would have loved to take this course as part of my undergrad!These course outlines were designed by hired professors &ndash;<a href=""http://chronicle.com/jobs/0000644740-01/"">here is an ad</a> in The Chronicle of Higher Education for ""College-Level Course Designers for Free Education Initiative"". They are licensed under Creative Commons BY license, and almost all the material is available as very nice HTML pages (except, for some reason, for the reading comprehension questions, and model answers).There&#039;s also school.saylor.org, a Moodle install where you can take the final exam in each course as a Moodle quiz. I took the final exam in the course mentioned above, about 50 multiple choice questions. I got 72% - a C-, but I didn&#039;t exactly study for it. Not sure what the intention with this site is - it isn&#039;t advertised anywhere, but is perhaps the first step in a process of offering more social features, or a pathway to accreditation.Here&#039;s Saylor&#039;s <a href=""http://blip.tv/file/4817760"">Alana Harrington presenting their project</a> as part of the OER University discussions, and she mentions that one of their outstanding problems is the accreditation.These course resources would work great for P2PU classes - bringing together people to go through the material together (I can imagine some great discussions between people who have been reading about Buddhist economics, anarcho-syndicalists and the Shakers!)Stian","Sarah Stewart => I think the accreditation problems is solved when OER courses are aligned with ""real"" educational institutions. have a look at the work that Wayne Mackintosh is doing with the OER University: <a href=""http://opensource.com/education/11/3/introducing-oer-university-5-questions-wayne-mackintosh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.com/education/11/3/introducing-...</a> . Alana Harrington => Thank you so much, Stian, for your post about our initiative (which is still, of course, a work in progress)!  We were touched by your kind commentary.  May I inquire as to how you came across our site?  The work of the OER titans you mention above (P2P, MIT OCW, Connexions, etc) has inspired our team and enabled us to put together some reasonably complete ""courses.""  We&#039;d love to keep in touch with you in the coming weeks and think that there are some interesting synergies between our models that could be exciting to discuss.  Thanks again, Stian!. "Guess that language,"languages,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/03/31/guess-that-language/,"<img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2610/3967470806_d3b2ac8e47_m.jpg"" alt="""" width=""240"" height=""159"" />I love languages, and linguistic games. I love learning new languages, seeing connections between different languages, because they are in the same language family, or because words were imported for different reasons (religion, trade, etc). For example, there are lots of cognates between Indonesian and Hindi, some come from Sanskrit and were brought into Indonesian during the pre-Islamic period, when India had a huge impact on Indonesia. Other words are from Arabic, and were brought in through Islam - and came to Hindi through Urdu. Utterly fascinating.Before I started studying Hindi, I had watched lot&#039;s of Hindi films, and I often tried to figure out some of the words just by reading the subtitles and seeing what they were saying. Trying to isolate nouns or verbs, and testing the theories when they would use the same words in new sentences. I also love being able to recognize scripts or sounds of languages I don&#039;t even speak. Most people can recognize Chinese, Japanese (although not everyone can separate the two), Russian, and Korean. But can you recognize Hindi (as opposed to Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati), Tamil, Georgian, Ethiopian and Mongolian?When I taught English in China, I used to play music from lot&#039;s of different languages on my DiscMan (before MP3 players), and have them guess which language it was in. I also played this game with my friend, we would play clips from different BBC World Service broadcasts, and have the other guess which language it was. For languages that you have never heard, you might still be able to guess the region or the family, based on the melody, the sounds, certain words you recognize, etc.I just came across a game that let&#039;s you do just that. It plays a sentence from the Declaration of Human Rights, 30 times, in 30 different languages, and asks you to guess. The quality of the sound is not the best at times, but it works well. I got 21 on my first play through, and 25 when I was able to go back and re-listen to a few clips (there is a time limit for doing this). When I revealed the answers, I saw three more languages that I could have been expected to guess, and two that I&#039;ve never really heard, and would not have been able to guess.<a href=""http://www.sporcle.com/games/1447/languages_audio"">How well can you do?</a><em>Update: <a href=""http://www.sporcle.com/games/lukebradford/guessthelanguage"">Here&#039;s one</a> with written sentences.

Wonder how \""the man in the street\"" would do on this one. Would be fun to give it to a high school class in Norway or something to see. Could be part of their \""global studies\"" curriculum :) . Tord Steiro => This is pretty cool! I am certainly not a language guy - I speak two languages, however, I managed to identify 16 languages correctly (17, if you include Portuguese, but I give it a fail since I kept misspelling it all the time...) which I am quite satisfied with!However, of the non-indo-european languages I only managed to identify Arabic, Hebrew, Mandarin and Vietnamese. Perhaps not that impressive after all... They all have they very specific signatures.. "P2PU Future Scenario on Collaboration,"academia/research,Education,open-education,p2pU,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/04/05/p2pu-future-scenario-on-collaboration/,"This term, I took a <a href=""http://www.kmdi.utoronto.ca/graduate-study/courses#KMD1002"">Knowledge Media and Design Institute</a> class on values and design. Part of the class was a group assignment that had us choose a public venue, and do unobtrusive participant observation (this could be a public square, a museum or another place where people congregate). Based on what we found through our ethnographic ministudy, and the readings and ideas from the class, we would come up with a design intervention to further a certain value. My group chose the value of ""collaboration"", and used <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">Peer2Peer University</a> as the ""venue"".We were able to do the study in P2PU, because all interactions are archived publicly - the ethics approval for the class would not have allowed us to do research on a class that was protected by password. For me, it was fun having a group of people with a lot of ideas around design and knowledge media, but who did not know much about P2PU. Of course, this was a small project in one class, so it cannot be seen as a full-scale research project, more to get your feet wet with ethnography and design, but it was still a lot of fun, and hopefully could inspire further work.The group visited several current and archived P2PU courses (here&#039;s <a href=""http://p2pu.org/general/node/15762/forums/27297"">an example ""notification""</a> that I posted in one of the courses to let them know that we were having a peek). We did not do any rigorous analysis of the data gathered, but from the notes that the group members took, their feeling was that course organizers were trying very hard to promote collaboration and peer-learning, but that participants did not take enough cognitive responsibility, which led to conversations that were very course organizer-centric.We discussed many possible reasons for this, and brainstormed ways of improving this state of affairs. We came up with a number of ideas, like designing some kind of an ""orientation"" for new participants, to let them understand better the P2PU principles. In the end though, we wanted to create a design intervention. Based on the readings from class, we thought that perhaps the linear design of the discussion forums, which lead to good ideas being ""buried"", could be a factor hindering deeper engagement from the students.To demonstrate our idea, we were asked to create a ""future scenario"" video. Creating a video always takes much longer than you think, but it was a fun assignment, and we were lucky to have a very photogenic ""protagonist"".<object width=""518"" height=""321""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/WgqYtOC29Ro?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/WgqYtOC29Ro?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""518"" height=""321""></embed></object>We also wrote <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/KMD1002%20Final%20-%20Collaboration%20at%20P2PU.pdf"">a small paper</a> describing some of the literature we consulted, and our thinking around the video.I am very interested in the theory around visual representations of discourse in online learning.

In our imagined alternative, each student can simply pull the ideas that appeal to them out of the thread to gather the most important thoughts and who contributed these thoughts."" I quite agree: a simple ""star"" mechanism would help with that!  But you go even further:""The student can then organize these ideas, creating a map that traces how the ideas link to each other.  These maps allow each student to understand and incorporate other perspectives to enrich her or his own perspective, which is an important foundation for collaborative learning.""Hm...! thanks to the ""star"" metaphor, this happens to remind me of the Khan Academy&#039;s dashboard interface,  http://bjk5.com/post/1664635835/constellation-knowledge  (though the interaction model would be somewhat different)..

However, I have still not taught a single course myself. Time to change that!I am currently doing my PhD at <a href=""http://www.oise.utoronto.ca"">OISE</a>, University of Toronto, as part of the <a href=""http://encorelab.org/"">Encore lab</a>. Our work is located within the field of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-supported_collaborative_learning"">Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning</a>, a very fascinating field which I have been spending the last year getting into, and whose <a href=""http://www.isls.org/cscl2011/index.htm"">major conference</a> I will attend for the first time this summer in Hong Kong. However, when getting into this field, I faced one challenge - OISE does not offer any courses directly on CSCL. Instead, you have to kind of ""pick it up"" by talking to fellow students, and your supervisor, doing the core readings yourself, etc.I figured this would be a great topic for a P2PU course. Much of the foundational literature in the course is open access (both because it is a relatively young field, and because many of the core researchers support OA - <a href=""http://ijcscl.org/"">the core journal in the field</a> is entirely OA, for example, meaning that we would be able to link to key readings without worrying about people being able to access them). In addition, the idea behind P2PU is ""peer-learning"", and this would be a true example: I am not organizing this course because I am an expert, but because I want someone to learn with.I was lucky enough to find Monica Resendes, a PhD student with <a href=""http://ikit.org/"">the IKIT lab</a>, also at OISE/University of Toronto. It&#039;s been very interesting discussing our different ideas about how we should approach this, and I really appreciate not doing this by myself.To get a feeling for the field, we began by surveying the key academics (as identified by being on the board of ijCSCL, the annual conference committee, etc) and looking at the people who had posted their syllabi online. <a href=""http://pad.p2pu.org/cscl-intro"">We found about fifteen faculty</a> who had done this (and often they had course syllabi going ten years back, many times with open wikis so we could see their students&#039; work as well). This gave us a sense of how core faculty see ""the field"", and which topics we should cover. There was much more than could be covered in an eight-week course, so we decided to create a separate ""analysis and assessment"" course, which will hopefully run sometime in the fall.We began writing up <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CH4hTowgZxIEE4KpXCrHLytzyTQKoj85_jbRpoVvY_w/edit?hl=en"">a course outline on Google Docs</a>, with tentative readings, and a structure for the course.

"Grading: evaluative or coercive?,"Education,open-education,p2pU,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/04/26/grading-evaluative-or-coercive/,"<strong>Introduction</strong>I have had many opportunities to think about grading and assessment this term. I am currently running a course called <a href=""http://bit.ly/intro-cscl"">Introduction to Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning</a>,and have thought a lot about incentive mechanisms and<a href=""http://bit.ly/badgepaper4"">badges</a> with <a href=""http://test.kmdi.utoronto.ca/graduate/students/#resendes"">Monica Resendes</a>, who is co-facilitating the course with me.I am also preparing to design and teach a course in ICT for development at Scarborough Campus in the fall, and as part of my preparations, I attended a two-day course design institute for graduate students with the <a href=""http://www.teaching.utoronto.ca/about_ctsi/servicesexpertise/ctsi-workshops/workshops.htm#Course%20Design%20Institute"">University of Toronto Center for Teaching Support &amp; Innovation</a> (CTSI), led by <a href=""http://www.teaching.utoronto.ca/about_ctsi/contact/assistantdirector.htm"">Megan Burnett</a>. This institute was a great experience, giving me a lot of new ideas, and new perspectives on things.During the same time, I was enrolled in an online class on Computer-Mediated Communications, and I brought many of the ideas from the CTSI institute into the class discussions, including this discussion of grading.<strong>Evaluative grading</strong>According to Megan, when you design a course, you should start with identifying your specific course goals and objectives, which can be content-specific or skill-specific. For example, an undergrad class might aim to both give you the ability to identify the main historical figures from the 20th century, and the skill to use proper MLA citation (as well as many other goals, of course).Only when you have these goals, do you look at assessment, and ask: what kinds of assessments are appropriate to test if the student has acquired the content knowledge and skills that you hoped. The key point is that you should only test this, not all kinds of other things - ie. if your goal is to teach your students to write proper English, then you should correct the English in their essays, not otherwise.<strong>Coercive grading</strong>However, thinking about the grading structure of many courses I have taken, I realized that there is a very different way of using grades - not to evaluate, but to compel behaviour.You could argue that all grades are too some extents designed to be &ldquo;compelling&rdquo; - humans are not like inert objects that can simply be measured, without it leaving any effect - clearly one of the functions of giving grades is to compel us to work harder (although in some cases, it can have the opposite effect). However, there are situations in which the grading has no evaluative aspect at all, and it functions merely as a carrot and stick to get students to do something - typically something the teacher believes is helpful to their learning.If, for example, you believe that students who write at least two posts per week learn more than students who don&rsquo;t, and you allot 15% of the grade to &ldquo;participation&rdquo; - ie. writing at least two posts per week, then you are not really &ldquo;assessing&rdquo; students ability to write two posts per week, you are simply using the grade coercively to &ldquo;punish&rdquo; those who do not do this.Perhaps there are students who differ from the average, and actually would learn much better by not participating in the forum at all? In a traditional undergraduate class, you can encourage them to come to class, but it is their choice, and if they choose not to, and do excellently on the essay and final exam, you&rsquo;ve got two choices: admit that your assessment methods do not properly capture the learning you wish to assess, or be very happy about their success.(Another issue is of course that since there is no pre-test, it is difficult to assess the ""value added&rdquo; of your specific course - perhaps they had this knowledge and skills before they joined your course. But at least your final assessment should make you confident that they have reached a level of knowledge and skill that you desire).<strong>Online courses</strong><strong></strong>What&rsquo;s interesting is that this &ldquo;coercive grading&rdquo; tends to be much more prevalent in online courses than in offline courses, partly perhaps because it is easier to do (with the wealth of statistics being captured, and made available to the teacher), and partly because the teacher is more afraid of student disengagement.At the CTSI workshop, they told me that UofT policy strongly discouraged including class attendance as one factor in grading. Yet almost all online courses include &ldquo;posting every week&rdquo; as one of their explicit or unspoken factors of assessment.When I brought this into the discussion in the online course, I received some very interesting feedback, implying that people felt very &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; about the term coercive grading, which seemed to have very negative connotations. For me, this concept of evaluative vs &ldquo;coercive&rdquo; or &ldquo;compelling&rdquo; grading is a really useful thought tool, and does not in itself imply any value judgment.In thinking about it, the first question should be whether this is a valid distinction, or whether there are other categories that should also be included. Another question altogether is whether, or in which circumstances, coercive grading might support the learning process. However, this is a discussion that we could not even begin to have, without having clarified the terms first.<strong>P2PU</strong>This is also a very interesting discussion when thinking about <a href=""http://p2pu.org/"">P2PU</a>, which has no coercive grading. We also have no evaluative grading right now, although we are developing an infrastructure for evaluation and recognition of learning achievements, focused much more on competency-based assessment. This really changes how we can implement different pedagogies, and the amount of leverage that a course organizer has over participants.Talking to a professor at UofT about his or her course, the discussion is structured very much in terms of power: &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have them do this, and then they&rsquo;ll have to do this&rdquo;. The students have paid good money for the course, and need a decent grade, so they have no choice but to comply. Whereas at P2PU, it is free to attend, there is not much external value (currently) in completing a course, and often you don&rsquo;t know the people you are studying with, or the course organizer, so there is less of a social commitment.The unrealistic ideal might be that students would be focused on their own learning goals (which they would have clearly outlined before the course), and would, with the support of the course organizer and other participants, pursue the learning that would be most useful for them to reach their learning goals, while at the same time supporting the learning community in the group. Of course, we know that this often does not happen, and sometimes we might wish we had the power to &ldquo;compel&rdquo; certain behaviour&hellip; But I think an environment without that power is a great place to experiment.","CSCL-intro week 1: Constructivism | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] that comes up very frequently when discussing new ways of teaching and learning.

"CSCL-intro week 1: Constructivism,"academia/research,CSCL-intro,Education,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/04/26/cscl-intro-week-1-constructivism/,"It is very exciting to see the <a href=""http://bit.ly/cscl-intro"">CSCL-intro course</a> come to life! <a href=""http://reganmian.net/monica/"">Monica</a> and I have been imagining this for many months, and been discussing and planning intensely for the last few weeks. Suddenly, people are doing the readings, writing blog posts, and engaging! Which means we have to do it too, because one of the basic premises of this course was that we would participate in exactly the same way as everyone else - after all, I&#039;m not organizing this course because I am an expert, and want to teach what I know, but because I need to learn, and want a group to learn together with!So during <a href=""http://new.p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-the-field-of-computer-supported-co/content/w1w2-intro-to-course-and-to-field/"">the first week</a>, we intended to have a soft startup, with some background readings, and more focus on getting to know each other, establishing the play rules, etc. We proposed a few readings on constructivism, and Communities of Practice:Readings:<ul><li><a href=""http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Constructivism"">Constructivism</a> on EduTechWiki (feel free to explore sublinks)</li><li><a href=""http://www.infed.org/biblio/communities_of_practice.htm"">Communities of Practice</a> on infed - the encyclopedia of informal learning</li></ul>I began with constructivism, and quickly got sucked down the rabbit hole... That&#039;s the dangerous thing about wikis after all, you start reading, and there are a bunch of links you want to explore, and before long, you are reading about [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]], [[radical constructivism]], and much more.<strong>Relationship between epistemology and instructional approach</strong>One of the things that struck me when reading the initial <a href=""http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Constructivism"">Edutech page</a>, was the differentiation between constructivism as an epistemology - how can we know, how can we learn, how does the brain process and store data, how is knowledge represented internally with the learner - and the choice of instructional approaches. I think today we often link the two automatically and assume that if somebody is using a constructivist approach, then their teaching will include group projects, expressive writing, debates and the production of artefacts.But the text states:<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Constructivist learning theory does not necessarily imply that one must follow a ""constructivist"" pedagogical strategy. In other words, most researches firmly believe that knowledge is constructed, but some (e.g. main stream instructional designers) do not adopt an instructional design that is labelled ""constructivist"".</p>and indeed, there is no doubt that we can learn ""constructively"" from a one-way stream of information. What I just did when researching this topic was a great example - I read a bunch of different wiki pages and articles, while taking notes for this blog post, and also adding information to different pages on my own [[about this wiki|wiki]].So, while reading, I am constantly processing the information, plotting it in to different parts of my notes, or wiki, comparing it with other things I&#039;ve read, other experiences, etc. Although the wiki did not have an instructional design, and certainly wasn&#039;t a collaborative learning experience, I learnt a lot. (And now I am hoping to learn even more, by sharing my ideas with others, and reading their ideas... And even the existence of this group is a great motivator for me. But there is no doubt that even without this, I could have learnt from these readings).It&#039;s interesting that <a href=""http://downes.ca"">Stephen Downes</a> is <a href=""http://www.downes.ca/presentation/272"">very much in favor of the lecture</a>. Obviously not as the ""best"" way of teaching, but as one way of many, which can be efficient if used well.<strong>Granularity of collaboration/sharing</strong>I have done quite a bit of thinking about the ""granularity"" of collaboration - for example the idea of maintaining a private wiki, rather than contributing to a public one (I think both are very useful), or the way we do in this course - spending significant amounts of time on our own with texts and lectures, taking notes, thinking it through, maybe even creating mindmaps and outlines - before we share our ideas with the others in the course. An alternative to this would be to have a shared environment where we do our brainstorming, and immediately share our smallest thoughts. This is kind of what Knowledge Forum is all about, which we will read about later in this course.(And of course, scientists ""knowledge build"" at a very low granularity - sharing the results of maybe years of research, experimentation, reading, synthesizing, experimentation, etc. But of course, there is hopefully much more high-granularity sharing within individual research groups, with advisors, etc).<strong>Assessment</strong><strong></strong>Assessment is a topic that comes up very frequently when discussing new ways of teaching and learning. I already wrote <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/04/26/grading-evaluative-or-coercive/"">one blog post</a> today about grading, although it was focused on a different topic.According to the <a href=""http://srri.umass.edu/topics/constructivism"">web page on constructivism at UMass</a>:<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""Constructivism calls for the elimination of grades and standardized testing. Instead, assessment becomes part of the learning process so that students play a larger role in judging their own progress.""</p>There isn&#039;t much justification given for this view, and I am not quite sure why that follows automatically. We talked a fair bit about group assessment, etc. I think my fundamental issue with it, and also the concept of ""group cognition"" (which we will also discuss later in this course), was the same thing that<a href=""http://kaffeikampala.blogspot.com/2011/04/i-want-individual-accreditation.html"">Martin</a> echoes today: this group is only temporary, and in the end, a company is going to decide to hire or not this specific person. And this specific person will have to do a certain job.An interesting counter-argument would be to say that when you hire someone, you&#039;re also hiring their network. This has long been true in lobbying and other contexts where personal networks are important, but with the growth of PLNs, perhaps you are not only hiring one person in isolation, but also the access that person has to knowledge and people distributed over that person&#039;s social network?(This still won&#039;t help a doctor who needs to make a split-second decision in an emergency, but it&#039;s something to think about, which hadn&#039;t occurred to me before just writing these lines, which says something about the power of producing artefacts for learning, I guess :))More about Communities of Practice later this week.Stian","Conceptually explicit representations for group learning and representational guidance | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] previously discussed the idea of granularities of collaboration (1, 2). In most of the cases that Suthers&#8217; experiments with, the granularity of collaboration is [...]. Martin Aa => Great post, this really made me think. Hiring persons for their PLN is probably much more important than I usually think. Assessment that fit the pedagogical strategy is good, but I guess I still would argue that assessment that fit the job the person is going to do is more useful. I heard the argument once that elimination of grades and standardized testing for nurses, replaced by evaluation of group work actually would kill a significant number of patients each year. I guess that might be right? (say you&#039;re staying with abdominal pain in a hospital where the young, newly educated nurse hasn&#039;t bothered to learn to calculate dosage of opioids during the studies because she knew noone would test that skill separately - well, you might be in trouble).

One of the innovations that Stephen Downes brought in with his first MOOC back in 2008 was the concept of ""The Daily"", a daily e-mail that would summarize the readings, the events, and some of the most interesting blog posts or other artefacts that course participants had created.This was especially necessary in the MOOC, because of the almost 2000 participants (although not everyone participated actively, there was an incredible amount of postings generated). We will not have anything near that size, but people often feel a bit ""lost"" in P2PU courses too (or in online courses in general). It can be easy to ""fall off"", and not be sure what exactly you are supposed to do, what is going on, etc. So we thought we&#039;d try to do a ""bi-weekly"" newsletter. I am posting this on my blog, because the broadcast feature on P2PU right now does not allow for rich text. I will blast out an announcement on P2PU each time I post a bi-weekly, which should reach all of you (we are still experimenting with the various communication systems, thank you for your patience!).<strong>We&#039;re off</strong>So for Monica and I, this is a very exciting time. We have been planning this course for a very long time, and to see people sign up, begin to blog, engage with the readings (and each other), tweet, comment on the P2PU site etc, is very exciting and rewarding! And since we are both committed to participate fully in the course, it&#039;s also exciting to be sitting down to actually read these resources that we have found, take notes, think about what to blog about, discuss with others, etc.<strong>Participants</strong><strong></strong>So far, we have 13 participants. There are two or so participants who applied, but didn&#039;t supply enough information - I left comments on their applications, and hope they got them, and will complete the applications. We decided to extend sign-up until Sunday night this week, so we might still get some more people.We also have 26 followers. They have not committed to go through the course, do all the readings etc, but they are welcome to the Big Blue Button meetings, and we hope to hear from them occasionally (or frequently). If they blog, it&#039;s best if they tweet the URL with the #csclintro tag (or check the Netvibes page to see if it shows up in the blog search). I will include links to blog posts from network participants in the bi-weekly as well.<strong>This week&#039;s topic</strong><strong></strong>This week, we are both warming up, getting used to the platform (we&#039;ve already had to make some adjustments), getting our blogs set up, etc. But we are also starting out with constructivism, which is an important educational philosophy often bandied about, but also often not very well understood. I really enjoyed sitting down with some of the texts, taking notes, and writing some blog posts, and I look forward to reading more of your thoughts.We are also looking at Communities of Practice, which is another very well known concept both within CSCL and the sister discipline Computer-Supported Collaborative Work.<strong>Resources for this week</strong><ul><li><a href=""http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Constructivism"">Constructivism</a> on EduTechWiki (feel free to explore sublinks)</li><li><a href=""http://www.infed.org/biblio/communities_of_practice.htm"">Communities of Practice</a> on infed - the encyclopedia of informal learning</li><li><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUQ6fSvLBVM"">Weekly video</a></li></ul><strong>Blog posts</strong><strong></strong>We had a number of people posting ""introductory posts"", talking about their participation in the course, their expectations: <a href=""http://jenniferclaro.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/210/"">Jennifer</a>, <a href=""http://reganmian.net/monica/projects/csclintro-course-at-p2pu/"">Monica</a>, <a href=""http://web.me.com/rebeccacober/Rebecca_Cober/Blog/Entries/2011/4/25_Jump_in_head_first_and_make_sure_you_get_your_feet_wet%21.html"">Rebecca</a>, <a href=""http://ottonomy.net/blog/2011/04/25/welcome-to-cscl-intr/"">Nate</a>,<a href=""http://kaffeikampala.blogspot.com/2011/04/intro-to-cscl.html"">Martin</a> (who also wrote about a <a href=""http://kaffeikampala.blogspot.com/2011/04/organizing.html"">neat way</a> of making the course feeds part of his daily Internet reading),<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/04/25/new-p2pu-course-intro-to-computer-supported-collaborative-learning/"">and I</a>.Monica added some <a href=""http://new.p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-the-field-of-computer-supported-co/content/w1w2-intro-to-course-and-to-field/"">great questions</a> on the weekly task, and <a href=""http://ottonomy.net/blog/2011/04/25/cscl-intro-wk-1-questions/"">Nate</a> jumped in trying to answer them.

I&#039;m enjoying reading your bi-weekly update. It is a neat way to end the weekend. I am reading through the blog postings, and tried to comment on Nate&#039;s blog, but had a hard time doing this. I couldn&#039;t quite find the right link! So I&#039;m going to comment here! :-) I haven&#039;t found an efficient way to organize the course materials yet. The Google home page idea that Nate suggested might be a very useful way to organize materials. Right now I have a lot of tabs open on my browser, a folder with the readings for each week, additional readings, and my blog. I also check the P2PU site frequently. It does feel a bit overwhelming, especially as new places to add feedback are being added, such as the PiratePad that Joe suggested. This is my first P2PU course, so hopefully by the end of the eight weeks I will be better organized and more e-learning savvy!!. CSCL Intro | => [...]  Posted on April 30, 2011 by openedblogger| Leave a comment   Stian Haklev has a new post introducing CSCL, an open online course. From the post:  We have been planning this [...]. "Grappling with ideas: convergence and divergence,"academia/research,CSCL-intro,Education,open-education,p2pU,plenk2010,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/05/17/grappling-with-ideas-convergence-and-divergence/,"Thanks to the generous recommendation by <a href=""http://zaidlearn.blogspot.com/"">Zaid Ali Alsagoff</a>, George Siemens invited me to give a talk to the <a href=""http://cck11.mooc.ca/"">Connectivism 2011 MOOC</a>. I decided that instead of giving a talk about something I know and have thought a lot about, like open access or OER, I would try to challenge myself by proposing a topic that I was in the middle of grappling with, where I really didn&#039;t know where I was going or what my conclusion would be. It&#039;s quite scary to be giving a presentation on something that is so ""raw"" in your mind, but I figured the CCK11 crowd was the perfect crowd for it, and the preparation of the slides helped me really gather my thoughts.<span style=""color: #3366ff;"">I have thought a lot about how we think and work with ideas, individually, in small groups online, in face-to-face workshops, and in distributed networks. There seemed to me to be something fundamentally similar with approaches to mind-mapping and note taking, collaborative discourse tools like Knowledge Forum and Compendium, innovative workshop methodologies like Unconferences and Open Space methodology, and visualizations and sensemaking of massive amounts of networked data... Yet whenever I read about one of these dimensions, they never seem to mention the others. So I tried to map out some of the overlapping areas, and principles that seem to apply.</span><span style=""color: #000000;"">This is something that I would love people&#039;s feedback on, but despite the fact that we have both an </span><a href=""https://sas.elluminate.com/site/external/jwsdetect/playback.jnlp?psid=2011-04-06.0734.M.D020A8F94687A60B3D95DF94DA4CE4.vcr&amp;sid=2008104"">Elluminate recording</a>, an <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/cck11.mp3"">MP3</a>, as well as <a href=""http://vimeo.com/22403448"">a Vimeo recording</a>, I knew that many are too busy to sit through a 45+ minute presentation. I wanted to do something similar to what I did with my presentation on <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/12/07/oer-for-a-multicultural-classroom-student-as-user-and-producer/"">OER and multicultural students</a>, where I exported all the slides into PNGs, added them to a blog entry, and then added text - both from the talk, and from other sources - around the pictures. It became a massive blog entry, but I got some very positive feedback on it.Lately, I have been playing around with a [[start|wiki]] to keep my notes. It&#039;s a<a href=""http://dokuwiki.org"">DokuWiki</a> installation, and I will write more about the specific setup later - I&#039;ve tweaked it quite a bit, and am becoming quite happy with it, but there are still a few more things to do. Anyway, I decided to try to do it in the wiki instead, both because it&#039;s much easier to handle so many pictures (just resize them with Automator, move them to the media directory, and create a file with {{idea001.png}, {{idea002.png}} etc, and then type the relevant text around those image links.This turned out to work excellently. See [[grappling_with_ideas|my extended notes here]]. The other advantage is that I can add links to wikipages on people or theories that I discuss. Currently, many of these are placeholders, because I&#039;ve just gotten started, but eventually I&#039;d like these pages to link to their most important articles, my notes from those articles, etc. (And already, there are some pages offering a lot more depth, like the one on [[tagging]], which I extracted from an online course I was doing this winter, or the one on [[monologic and dialogic learning]], where you can both see my organized notes, and the [[ref:hoadley1999between|raw notes]] from reading the article.I later wrote a paper for a course, where I also tried to process some of these ideas. This was my first paper written with<a href=""http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/"">Multi-Markdown</a>, using<a href=""http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/"">Pandoc</a> to process the<a href=""http://www.bibtex.org/"">Bibtex bibliography</a> (I&#039;ll write more about these things later too). The nice thing about this, was that I could then use Pandoc to convert the Markdown document to Mediawiki markup, which is very similar to DokuWiki. Thus I was able to publish the [[grappling_with_ideas-the_paper|entire paper]] as a very nicely formatted wiki page. Much nicer than PDF, if you ask me!Hopefully you&#039;ll find the talk interesting, whichever format you consume it in, and I would love to hear ideas on how to take my thinking further, especially if you know about anyone who has been looking at all these different levels before - seems to me that most thinkers concentrate on one, whether it&#039;s [[Tony Buzan]] and his [[the_mind_map_book|mind mapping]] (individual), or [[Marlene Scardamalia]] and her [[knowledge building]], etc.StianPS: You&#039;ll notice a tiny little icon behind links to the [[start|wiki]].

It&#039;s also gigantic, easily the largest meeting of educators in the world, with <a href=""http://aera.net/2011AnnualMeeting.htm"">this year&#039;s meeting</a> bringing some 13,000 attendees spread over 5 large hotels in downtown New Orleans.This was my first time to AERA, and it was quite an overwhelming experience -- with often more than 100 parallel sessions going on at any time, on anything from adolescence to zone of proximal development, I tried to attend a variety of sessions in my field, to get a sense of the research going on. I also tried to take quite detailed notes on my new [[:start|wiki]], which worked really well (especially because I could do it offline -- connectivity was not the best).I have a [[aera11:start|general list of all my AERA11 notes]], and here I&#039;ll highlight some of the interesting sessions I went to. (I didn&#039;t get notes from all sessions, sometimes because I was too tired, or I didn&#039;t find it relevant, sometimes because I was out of power. I am seriously considering buying an external powerbar for future conferences, because having the ability to take notes throughout the day is a significant advantage.)There was very little about open education at AERA, although Wendy Drexler did [[aera11:ple|a presentation about a MOOC]]. I hope to see more research on MOOCs, open courses, PLEs and so on, at future sessions. I was very happy that I went to the evening meeting of the special interest group on self-regulated learning. Allyson Hadwin gave [[aera11:hadwin|an interesting presentation about fostering self-regulated learning in university students]], but the papers I read before coming to the meeting were even more interesting, and I feel [[self-regulated learning]] and [[self-directed learning]] are fields that hold great promise for open education. How can we better help students at P2PU, or in MOOCs, motivate themselves, be meta-cognitively aware of their own learning, etc? (This was also one of the few occasions where I had time to do some reading before the meeting, which was very helpful).[[aera11:gerhard fischer|Gerhard Fischer]], a well known figure in CSCL, gave a great presentation on ""a culture of participation"". He seems to be doing some very interesting work, and is definitively someone I want to read more about/of. In the same session, there were also very good presentations by [[aera11:sharon derry|Sharon Derry]], [[aera11:Mike Eisenberg|Mike Eisenberg]] and [[aera11:Alexander Repenning|Alexander Repenning]].[[Dan Hickey]] gave [[aera11:dan hickey|a very inspiring presentation]] on participatory assessment, with many examples from his own work in schools and at university. Ever since I got to know him at P2PU&#039;s assessment workshop in Palo Alto, I&#039;ve been very impressed by his work, and look forward to read more (see examples of his work at <a href=""http://workingexamples.org/frontend/people/10"">Working Examples</a>).There were a number of interesting presentations on pedagogical agents, by [[aera11:Heller, Procter|Heller, Procter]], [[aera11:Kim|Kim]], [[aera11:Haake. Silvervarg et al|Haake. Silvervarg et al]], [[aera11:Veletsianos|Veletsianos]], [[aera11:Adcock|Adcock]] and [[aera11:Overmyer|Overmyer]].

I have read a number of their papers before, and have quite a bit of experience with Knowledge Forum, the platform that they developed (I also made <a href=""http://vimeo.com/17143638"">a screencast</a> to demonstrate how Knowledge Forum works, and can be used in a university class). This was a good opportunity to read the paper closely, taking [[ref:scardamalia2006knowledge|very detailed notes]], and look at some of the questions I still have.<strong>Integrative learning and science</strong>One of the key ideas behind KB for me, is the difference between cumulative and [[ref:scardamalia2006knowledge#integrative|integrative]] artefacts. Scardamalia refers to literature reviews that scientists produce, and this reminds me of the initial OLNet proposal, which <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/08/01/very-exciting-new-initiative-to-organize-research-around-open-education/"">I blogged about three years ago</a>. Later, she discusses the similarities between knowledge building discourse, and [[ref:scardamalia2006knowledge#relationship_between_learning_and_work|knowledge work in professional communities]]. She states that:<blockquote>In scientific and scholarly research teams, knowledge building often proceeds with no special technology to support it. This is possible because knowledge building is woven into the social fabric of the group and in a sense all the technology used by the group supports it.</blockquote>However, I wonder why she doesn&#039;t spend more attention on how professionals can improve their knowledge work. CSCL has a sister-discipline in Computer-Supported Collaborative Work, which has spent a lot of time looking at ways to improve for example knowledge management in companies and organizations. Scardamalia posits the scientific discourse as some kind of ideal, and there is no doubt that it is powerful, but there is currently a whole lot of very exciting work centered around improving the collaboration for scientists -- things like open notebook science, wikis, social networks for citation sharing, linking datasets, etc.When I go to the <a href=""http://ikit.org/resources.html"">IKIT website</a> and see a list of more than 150 publications, I wonder if there isn&#039;t a better way in which the knowledge could be presented. I would love to see a wiki on Knowledge Building, where I could click on ""scaffolds"", and I would instantly see ""the state of knowledge for the community"" about scaffolds, the different definitions, the different ways of using them, the different research projects that have used them, and ""we still need to understand""... What are the open questions in Knowledge Building research? What are the challenges that the community grapples with? How does new research ""fit in"" with what exists?<strong>Pedagogy</strong>Scardamalia doesn&#039;t write [[ref:scardamalia2006knowledge#pedagogy|much about pedagogy]] in this article, although she refers to a few other articles (which I&#039;d like to read in the future), however I&#039;ve both taken one of her classes, and observed/heard about some of the primary school classes. I know that she does not want to provide any ""blueprints"" for how to run a class, however I think this makes it very difficult for people to adopt these principles. She mentions that working with Knowledge Forum should not be the only activity in the class, they might go on excursions, do experiments, etc. In practice, one of the things I observed in the primary school classroom was ""knowledge talks"", where the teacher would project a Knowledge Forum database on the wall, and talk through it with the kids, the database being their ""shared artifact"" that they can refer to in their discussions.I am quite fascinated by this interplay between asynchronous individual (although in practice the students often sit in groups typing in messages to the computer, for some of the small kids, the teachers also help them) activity and synchronous group activity. How do you best structure a ""knowledge talk"" to help with the productive discourse? If you run an online class, could this be replaced by a meeting in Big Blue Button, or on Etherpad? (Of course, it would loose the facility of easily pointing to nodes, and saying ""I think this one was very useful"").<strong><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://vdc.cet.edu/images/image001DP11.jpg"" alt="""" width=""422"" height=""308"" />The Knowledge Forum environment</strong>It&#039;s pretty much impossible to discuss Knowledge Building without mentioning Knowledge Forum, the platform which was formerly called CSILE, and which has formed the center-piece of Scardamalia&#039;s research for the last 25 years. While there is no doubt that this environment has been very useful, enabling a lot of experimentation, especially in the early days when there was nothing else like it, I feel like this single-minded focus on Knowledge Building has held the theory back. Not only because the environment is not freely available (although an open source modernized version might be coming out), but also because the theory should apply much more broadly, and I think trying to foster Knowledge Building using different environments would also enrich the theory.Many of the Knowledge Building papers complain about threaded discussions, but today we have so many more environments, from wikis to twitter, to blogs with pingback and comments, RSS feeds, aggregators, etc. (I discussed with Monica whether we could make a plugin for WordPress that provided a similar ""scaffold"" with ""My theory is"", ""We still need to understand"", ""This explains"", etc. Wouldn&#039;t be very hard technically). And as we will see next with with Dan Suther, there are actually a number of other graphical discourse environments with subtly different characteristics. The only paper I know of, which tries to foster a Knowledge Building environment with two environments is<a href=""http://userweb.port.ac.uk/~kingt/research/OUTLINE%20PAPER-v7.pdf"">Duke-Williams and King</a>, who compare the use of Elgg with Knowledge Forum. And Konrad Glogowski, who was a doctoral student with Scardamalia, wrote <a href=""http://www.teachandlearn.ca/blog/2007/07/30/instructional-scaffolding/"">amazing posts</a> about using blogs with his students, although I don&#039;t think he was trying to foster traditional Knowledge Building.Stian","CSCL-intro The Bi-Weekly #7 | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] far, I think I am the only one who has blogged about these two readings, on Scardamalia and on Stahl.

"All the raw notes from my MA thesis: Chinese National Top Level Courses,"academia/research,Education,MA thesis,open access,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/05/18/all-the-raw-notes-from-my-ma-thesis-chinese-national-top-level-courses/,"I completed my MA thesis on the Chinese National Top Level Courses Project in September 2010, and since then, I have been experimenting with publishing the results in <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">a variety of different formats</a>. I not only made available the classic double-spaced nicely formatted PDF, but also a more compressed two-column single-spaced version fit for printing, and DOC, RTF and ODT versions of both of the above. In addition, since I am a big proponent of e-readers (and love my Kindle), I created epub and mobi files.I also syndicated the ""best parts"" of my thesis on this blog over several months last fall, which served two purposes. First, it meant that people who ordinarily might never get around to reading a 100 page PDF, could simply get it ""drip-fed"" every day. (I know I have many MA and PhD theses on my harddrive which I will ""get around to some day"", but I also read many blogs daily). I know from personal feedback that several people read the whole thesis in this way.In addition, it gives each individual ""chunk"" of the thesis it&#039;s own URL. This makes it much easier to link to, reblog or retweet (which happened with a number of the pieces, they were picked up by Stephen Downes, Open Education News, etc).I am committed to being an <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/10/24/how-to-be-an-open-scholar-oa-week-2010/"">open scholar</a>, but for various reasons, the research process leading up to the publication of my MA was not very ""open"". However, in addition to publishing the polished end-result in a variety of formats, I also wanted to make available some of the ephemera that was generated in the production process, the stuff that is usually left on the cutting floor.I used <a href=""http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/"">DevonThink</a> to keep downloaded PDFs, webpages, and initial notes, and I later moved all the notes into <a href=""http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php"">Scrivener</a>, which I used for the entire writing process. I absolutely love Scrivener, and couldn&#039;t imagine writing this thesis without it. (See a <a href=""https://picasaweb.google.com/shaklev/MAThesisDraftInScrivener"">gallery of screenshots</a> from my Scrivener database).After completing the thesis, I had the idea that I wanted to make all my raw notes from the writing process available. I was not planning on this from the outset, and so made no effort at structuring these in any useful way, they are a complete mess. However, it might be interesting to some, both to see how I structured the writing process, and to find extra material that did not make it into the finished thesis.Scrivener can export a database to HTML files, however it does not generate any kind of index for these files. I wrote a little Ruby-script which goes through a folder hierarchy and creates a web-view, either with two or three panes. I used this to publish <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/scrivener-web"">my entire Scrivener database on the web</a>. The <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/scrivener.zip"">entire Scrivener file</a> is also available, so if you have Scrivener (there is a free trial version available), this is probably easier.The only thing I have removed is all references to my interview participants, because of privacy, and the Chinese transcripts, because I need more time to go through them and make sure there is no identifying information there. I am almost ready to publish the Chinese translation of my entire thesis, and I will try to get the full interview transcripts up at that time as well.Would love some feedback, whether you find this useful or not.

(However, we were very inspired by <a href=""http://www.freelancepropaganda.com/archives/MP3vPDF.pdf"">a paper</a> comparing management of academic metadata with MP3 collections, and added some of this to our proposal).We began by looking at existing software, and <a href=""http://www.encorewiki.org/display/KMDI2003/Screen+captures"">capturing screenshots</a> of some of the designs that we found elegant or practical. After <a href=""http://www.encorewiki.org/display/KMDI2003/Notes"">brainstorming</a> various issues and possible solutions, we collaboratively wrote a ""future scenario"", <a href=""http://www.encorewiki.org/display/KMDI2003/Future+Scenario"">""a day in the life of a junior researcher""</a>. Finally, our designer-talent Rebecca <a href=""http://www.encorewiki.org/download/attachments/6357272/centre5.gif"">created a diagram</a> of our thinking, and using a number of different existing programs, and some ""sleigh of hands"", we made a screencast of what an ideal workflow ""could look like"".We based ourselves on <a href=""http://mekentosj.com/papers/"">Papers</a>, with its very friendly design and high usability, but ""added"" a number of functions that the developers of Papers would be surprised to see. We used <a href=""http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/"">Skim</a> to show highlighting of papers, and <a href=""http://www.devon-technologies.com/support/academy/index.html"">DevonThink</a> to show displaying and sorting through snippets, with Kindle integration. Inspired by the graphical interface in <a href=""http://www.sciplore.org/software/sciplore_mindmapping/"">SciPlore</a>, we used <a href=""http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/"">Tinderbox</a> to mock up a ""mind map"" view of the snippets, and finally brought it back to Papers.We hope none of the authors of all these excellent packages will object to our borrowing them for this little movie. We did make very clear in the introductory text that this does not represent existing functionality, but hopefully it can be an inspiration for developing some of this functionality in the future. (Despite of this warning, one person who viewed it was very excited, and asked how he could download this new version of Papers).<object width=""500"" height=""314""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/XXDwlqX0RCY?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"" /><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true"" /><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always"" /><embed type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""500"" height=""314"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/XXDwlqX0RCY?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true""></embed></object>Quite apart from this mock-up, but perhaps partly inspired by it, I&#039;ve been working hard at setting up my ""PhD information architecture"", figuring out how to keep notes, references, citations, PDFs etc organized in a way that both supports my own knowledge work, and lets me share as much as possible with others. I&#039;ve come up with a pretty neat solution, which I will write more about soon.Stian","houshuang => Very good point. In fact, my current setup, which I will blog about as soon as I find the time, is a great mishmash of several different applications, held together with small Ruby scripts and AppleScript, javascript bookmarklets, php plugins, etc. However, it\&#039;s taken me weeks of tinkering and several all-nighters, and right now, it\&#039;s something that most of my friends in graduate school would neither be able to do, nor have the time to do. I wish some of these programs were made to more easily work together, and not impose a single workflow.   And even though some never citation management tools look fancy, I am surprised at the functionality they lack. \""Oh, you don\&#039;t just want to insert a citation in a Word document, but also in your WordPress blog? In your wiki? You want to sync to your Kindle, and have the notes come back? You want to share those notes with others? You want to insert microformats in your blog post, so web spiders and Zotero semantically know about the citation you referenced? You want to write in MultiMarkdown, and seamlessly generate HTML, PDFs and DOCs?\"" -- lot\&#039;s of stuff we couldn\&#039;t show in the video, because making such a video takes a lot of time, even for simple functionality. . Mark Bernstein => A clever concept!  I wonder, though, whether the implied tight integration is sound design. Do we WANT to have everything in one app?  That implies a monoculture, like Word, where all researchers would use pretty much the same tool.  Me, I like having lots of tools, which means the shifting among applications is actually a good thing. If you don&#039;t like Papers, use Bookends; if you want to end up in Scrivener, that&#039;s fine..

Stahl is a key figure in the CSCL movement, as an editor of <a href=""http://ijcscl.org/"">ijCSCL</a>, the key CSCL journal, and a prolific publisher. He is also an incredibly generous academic, sharing an incredible amount of information on his <a href=""http://gerrystahl.net/"">website</a>. He even <a href=""http://gerrystahl.net/elibrary/"">compiled ebooks</a> of many of his papers, put together in a systematic fashion, made available most of his published books as OA, and even published <a href=""http://gerrystahl.net/elibrary/proposals"">all of his grant proposals</a> (including the failed ones). I am very impressed by an academic who is so committed to sharing his work.<strong>The paper</strong>This week&#039;s papers are both dense and rich. We could probably spend an entire course just exploring the arguments being made in either paper. Of the two, I was more comfortable with Scardamalia&#039;s paper, since I am familiar with Knowledge Building. I found Stahl&#039;s paper quite difficult, especially since he tends to get philosophical, invoking Heidegger and Hegel (after all, <a href=""http://gerrystahl.net/elibrary/marx"">his PhD thesis</a> was in philosophy, on Marx and Heidegger).He divides the paper into four parts, and I will touch on these four parts here:<ul><li>collaborative knowledge building</li><li>group and personal perspectives</li><li>mediation by artifacts</li><li>micro-analysis of conversation</li></ul><strong>Collaborative knowledge building</strong>I found his comparison between learning and Knowledge Building (KB) quite interesting. He notes that learning is everywhere, and can even happen unconsciously (""even non-conscious activity can reinforce tacit competences""). It&#039;s also very hard to measure, only the consequences can be measured (and this is often problematic).On the other hand, KB refers to specific, identifiable occurrences, and because it necessarily takes place in observable media, can be directly and empirically observed (useful for researchers). In this article, KB is thought of a group process, but even an individual who is engaged in deep and sustained work with ideas, will probably want to [[grappling_with_ideas-the_paper#externalization|externalize]] his/her ideas in a systematic fashion.He discusses a number of other approaches to collaborative learning, and notes a problem with project-based learning (which could probably apply to many of the settings when educators want kids to ""collaborate""):<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""A potential issue with project-based activities that do not adhere to a model like PBL is that tasks often get divided up so that participants cooperate (as opposed to collaborate) on the over-all project but do not collaborate on the knowledge building; they may subsequently share their individual expertise through<a title=""jigsaw"" href=""http://localhost/wiki/jigsaw"">jigsawing</a> (Brown &amp; Campione, 1994), but the basic knowledge building takes place outside the group interaction""</p>To me, this goes back to the difference between having an artifact as the goal, and the process as the goal. If we were collaborating on writing a book, or a Wikipedia article, together, the quality of the result would be measured by the quality of the artifact. It would not matter very much how we did it (except perhaps to determine the order of the authors), and division and specialization would be expected. However, if we are creating this artifact <em>in order to learn</em>, then this kind of division becomes problematic.What&#039;s interesting is that earlier in the article, Stahl says of the goal of KB:<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""Emphasize the construction and further development of a knowledge object that is shared by the group or &ldquo;community of learners.&rdquo; Not personal learning by the participants,<em>however</em> they will retain some of what the group discovered, deepen their collaboration skills and enjoy positive experiences of inquiry and intellectual engagement.""</p>So if the goal of KB is the construction of a knowledge object, then why should we criticize approaches that lead to a good knowledge object, but does not let everyone learn from the approach? In the quote above, it sounds like the individual learning is more of an after-thought? (Perhaps the key is the ""that is shared by the group"", meaning that everyone has to be intimately involved in the production of the knowledge object?)<strong>The individual and the social</strong>He writes that only individuals can interpret objects (""symbols, representations and artifacts are only meaningful to individal minds"", ""interpretation is carried out by individuals, within horizons of personal perspectives (Gadamer 1960/1988)""), but that ""isolated from social interaction, physical artifacts and historical cultures, human brains are poor thinkers and could never have developed into powerful minds (Donald, 1991)"". It follows from this that a learning theory needs to account for both the individual and the social. I haven&#039;t often found a specific mention of the individual in CSCL literature, so I find this useful, however I wish he would have expanded on it.In my paper [[Grappling with ideas-the paper|Grappling with ideas]], I introduced the concept of [[grappling_with_ideas-the_paper#micro-_and_macro-levels_of_collaboration|micro- and macro levels of collaboration]]:<blockquote>To tackle this question, I would like to introduce the idea of different granularities of collaboration &mdash; how much of the working with ideas takes place in your own head, and at what point do you share your thoughts with others? On one end of the spectrum, at a micro-level of collaboration, you might have two people who knew each other well, who were engaged in a discussion about a problem, vocalizing every idea that comes through their mind, working together as one mind to solve the problem.At the very other far end of the scala, the macro-level of collaboration, might be found the scientific world, where individual PhD researchers might read hundreds of books and articles, take thousands of pages of notes, diagrams, before they finally publish their dissertation, which deals with decades worth of literature. A few years after the publication of the dissertation, an article might be published that builds upon the ideas in the dissertation, a few years later, a new article, and so on. (Of course, the PhD student might be part of a local research team, and might exchange ideas with them at a much lowergranularity).This is a useful distinction, because it covers many areas where we instinctively feel that there is collaboration and knowledge building going on, such as the edublogosphere, where you can see a progression of ideas and a community understanding of the current state of knowledge in the field, yet there are no affordances in the tools we use, that make this knowledge building easier.We can also experiment with lowering thegranularityof collaboration in fields where thegranularityto the public has traditionally been quite high - an example would be the movement for Open Notebook Science in academia, where researchers who would traditionally hoard their lab results until the final paper was published are not voluntarily sharing their data in almost real-time with anyone who might be interested (Bradley 2007).</blockquote>Recently, <a href=""http://oveucsj.posterous.com/online-learning-risks-and-opportunities"">Ove Christensen</a> tweeted ""An education is more than just passively listening to lectures.&rdquo; I replied asking &ldquo;Who says I am ""passively"" listening to the lectures? Just as I am ""passively"" reading great books?&rdquo; This was in relation to the many Open Educational Resources which comprise of PDFs and lecture recordings. Certainly, the entire P2PU is founded on the idea that more active engagement with ideas is needed, however that does not mean that these resources are not useful. And this post is one example - if you go to the [[ref:stahl2002contributions|article&#039;s page]] on my wiki, you&#039;ll see how I worked with it. I first added it to my citation management system, then opened it in Skim. I read through it, highlighting relevant passages. I exported these to the wiki, and then went through them, trying to compile the most important ideas in my own language.And now I am blogging about some of the questions that the article raised, linking this with other articles and people&#039;s contributions. This is all what I would call very active engagement with ideas, not at all ""passively reading an article"". Yet the article itself is passive, and for someone looking at the web statistics, they would only see ""One PDF downloaded"".<strong>Artifacts and analysis</strong>Stahl writes a great deal about artifacts and mediation, using concepts both from philosophy and anthropology. I find his writings fascinating, but difficult to penetrate or ""pin down"". Perhaps I need some concrete ""examples"". Probably I need to do more readings (perhaps some of the ones he cites), and then come back to this article, slowly teasing out what he means. Theoretically this might be a place where the community in this class could help me tease out the meaning that I cannot easily access on my own. Yet that is also where the weakness of our collaboration shows. By the time you read this blog post, we will almost be over in next week, with new readings and new topics.We could spend weeks unpacking this material, especially given the little time available that each of us has. And if this was a true Knowledge Building class, perhaps we would now abandon all structure, and focus on this question that has appeared (or improvable idea). Yet, this brings two problems. First, everyone in the class might not find this very interesting at all. Second, there is clearly a value to covering a lot of ground, and getting an overview of the field, without spending the entire eight weeks burrowing down into one specific topic. The converse is also true. Perhaps we will structure the course differently next time. And perhaps another environment, that is at a higher granularity than blog posts, such as Knowledge Forum, would be more appropriate for that kind of interaction.Stian","Monica => I&#039;m a new course facilitator on P2PU, but it hasn&#039;t taken long for me to become preoccupied with questions like: ""how do we evaluate or assess &#039;success&#039; in any given course? How can we see whether any particular study group was successful in collaboratively building knowledge? The starting point seems to be examining the traces of the course.  As Stahl states: ""With care and practice, one can directly and empirically observe the knowledge being built, because it necessarily takes place in observable media, like talking. Moreover, it produces knowledge objects or artifacts, which provide lasting evidence and a basis for evaluating the knowledge building.""I&#039;m wondering if there are examples of courses or study groups that took continuous part in assessing &#039;success&#039; based on the traces of the course process (blog posts, newsletters, comments, etc). Are there examples of fruitful ways to build group assessment into courses themselves? ie. at certain points, a collective effort is taken to summarize and reflect on the state of a group&#039;s current &#039;knowledge pool&#039;, to plot out next steps, or at least a direction in which to push the frontiers? It would be ideal if such a practice could function as a norm or established practice rather than as just another &#039;task&#039; or &#039;activity&#039; to be completed. In the csclintro course, the Bi-Weekly&#039;s seem to take up the task of summarizing group activity and current state of knowledge (in a shallow way) by providing a general overview and linking to evidence. In some sense, the piratepad conversations have invoked the question of &#039;where to go from here?&#039;, but more in the sense of &#039;what kind of artifact do we want to focus our collaborative energies on?"" There&#039;s less focus on evaluating where our collective IDEAS about the various concepts and issues raised in readings are going, where they seem to be converging or diverging from each other. On the other hand, perhaps the goal of the course, which is to become familiarized with the field of CSCL, is far too broad to really necessitate such a conversation, as we&#039;re not dealing with a specific problem of understanding. My sense is that is the case, however it is interesting to think about the idea that an established &#039;norm&#039; in an online course where knowledge building is a central underlying intent is iterative group reflections about the current state of knowledge and the next steps needed to advance the frontiers productively.. "CSCL-intro The Bi-Weekly #7,"CSCL-intro,open-education,p2pU,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/05/19/cscl-intro-the-bi-weekly-7/,"<strong>I&#039;m back in the game!</strong><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_0zhFe8pB7to/TdXaYVdi0TI/AAAAAAAAE1A/gxZPeGCWmic/s288/P1000378.JPG"" alt="""" width=""288"" height=""216"" />Due to a number of circumstances, I was absent from the course for about two weeks. This was much longer than I had planned, and I apologize for it. I am also very grateful to Monica for her great work in the interim. It feels great to be back, seeing the energy of the course, and getting back into it.It was quite overwhelming to re-enter the course after two weeks, which made me think about is how we can help people who ""fall off"" a course get back on. Related to this, I sent gentle messages to a number of core participants who haven&#039;t been very active, inviting them to rejoin us, we&#039;ll see if anyone takes me up on it.My initial instinct would be to start with the readings in week 2, and slowly work through everything to ""catch up"". However, experience has taught me that that might not be the best way - while you are busy catching up, the course marches forward, and you might never be able to get back on the train. So I focused on the readings for week 4, and intend to go back and ""backfill"" once I get time.<strong>Weekly meeting</strong><div><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_0zhFe8pB7to/TdXaauPyk6I/AAAAAAAAE1I/CNk24KncJwE/s288/P1000381.JPG"" alt="""" width=""288"" height=""216"" />I&#039;m moving this up to make sure you see it.

The asynchronous part is all the work that is done throughout the week, reading articles, posting blog posts, or comments on the site, collaborating on a wiki article, etc. The synchronous part is usually the ""mass-meeting"", where all the participants who are able to make it, ""meet"" at a common time.I wrote a short paper for a course last year about the different elements of synchronous communications, and I tried to extract the most relevant ideas on <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/Synchronous_meetings"">a wiki page</a>.There I listed the following ""uses"" of synchronous meetings at P2PU:<div><ul><li><div>can be very important for social cohesion, and motivation</div><ul><li><div>making participants feel closer to the group</div></li><li><div>generating a greater feeling of shared responsibility than is easily possible through asynchronous communications</div></li></ul></li><li><div>pace-setter in the course, through having weekly tasks that have to be performed before the synchronous meeting at a set time, because participants are expected to present or discuss certain topics.</div></li><li><div>showcase of projects that individual students or small groups of students have undertaken.</div></li><li><div>virtual office hours, where students are able to directly get feedback and ask for help on problems that they are stuck on, both from the course organizer, and for the other participants.</div></li><li><div>an opportunity to take stock of the conversation so far, and have the community converge around key ideas, and generate a shared understanding of the state of knowledge in the community, to enable moving forwards as a group.</div></li><li>can be very powerful for collaborative knowledge building around artefacts, see below the discussion about the interaction between synchronous tools and artefacts.</li></ul>In a recent P2PU course that I took at OISE, I definitively felt the lack of any weekly meeting (this course was purely asynchronous, you were expected to log into a discussion forum several times per week, read what had been written, and post new notes). Not only did I never have a chance to hear the voices or talk directly with the others in the class (except for the teacher, who posted brief weekly video summaries), but it also made it harder to ""keep up"" with the course. That is what I meant by ""pace-setter"" above... If you are a busy student, with a number of courses and other projects, you often live by your calendar, and when a lecture is coming up, you know that you need to do the readings and prepare. But it is easy for a course that doesn&#039;t appear in the calendar at all to be forgotten or ignored.<strong>Technology and pedagogy</strong>Given the use of synchronous meetings though, there are two key questions to be answered <strong>""technology and pedagogy"". </strong>Not only what tools you will use, but also how you will organize the meeting to be most useful to whatever purpose you prioritize. There are quite a lot of writings on how to conduct effective classroom lectures, tools for energizing the students, etc., but I have not seen anything on how to conduct a useful discussion group in Elluminate, for example. (I&#039;d love to hear about it, if it exists).As for the technology to use during this ""mass-meeting"", previous course organizers have tried a number of approaches, from Skype group calls, to Tokbox, conference calls, etc. And we not only use these tools for course meetings, there are also many organizational meetings at P2PU, whether the weekly community call or smaller group meetings. Personally I find large group calls on Skype or conference call quite tiresome. The audio quality is never great (on conference call, it&#039;s uniformly poor, on Skype, there will always be one person with problems), Skype keeps kicking people out, everyone either starts talking at once, or are all silent, etc. You leave such a meeting feeling exhaustion, rather than the exhilaration that can come from a great conversation.I was excited about P2PU getting access to Big Blue Button, because I have had a few work meetings with Elluminate, which worked quite well, given that we could more easily see who was talking, share screens etc. However, the first attempts of using BBB with our #CSCLintro course was not a great success. BBB has much poorer echo-cancellation than Skype and other commercial tools, and if not every single group member uses headphones, there will be constant disruption. (And somehow, there will never be a group where everyone manages to remember headphones :)). It is possible to mute and unmute members, but in the end, this was so tiresome, that we ended up migrating naturally to Etherpad.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-23-at-8.07.51-PM.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1022"" title=""Screen shot 2011-05-23 at 8.07.51 PM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-23-at-8.07.51-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""302"" /></a>Etherpad has a chat window, together with a large collaborative editing window. This is a nice combination - you can discuss in the chat, while you work out things together in the editing window. Since the editing window is synchronous, and everyone gets a different color, sometimes the chat migrates directly into the document. We used that for two group meetings which I was unable to participate in, and reading the transcripts (Etherpad also let&#039;s you ""play back"" the creation of the document, but unfortunately, not synchronized with the chat messages), it was a very lively meeting.Sometimes people are concerned with things getting out of hand, and two many conversation threads going on at the same time, as well as typing being slower than thinking (although with a lot of people, you can get more said with text than with voice, because only one can talk at the same time, and we read far faster than we listen), but overall it was quite nice.Another benefit of text chat is that it is much easier to review later, and even analyze. Nate Otto did <a href=""http://ottonomy.net/temp/cscl-intro/interactive-chatlog-wk3.html"">a great visualization</a> of how different topics weaved in and out of our conversation.<strong>Idea: Etherpad + Skype</strong>However, I didn&#039;t want to give up on voice conversation. I had a few Skype calls with my co-organizer Monica this spring, which have been amazingly productive - really entering a ""state of flow"", building on each other&#039;s ideas, to the extent that I began recording them, to not loose any of it. I wanted to share that intellectual excitement with the participants in the course, and also the personal connection which comes from that more direct communication. I realized that I really like one-on-one conversations, and also that I had almost never had any problems getting Skype to work for calls with only one other person - it&#039;s with group-calls that things get difficult.So we had the idea of combining these aspects. We had everyone join the Etherpad at the allotted time, and asked them to write down in the pad their Skype names, and also which of the two articles of the week they had read (ideally everyone would have read both, but reality is not perfect). We then randomly paired people up with each other, who had read the same article, and gave them ten (extended to 15) minutes to discuss the articles. They were free to discuss any issues that they had come up with, but were also referred to the guiding questions that Monica had prepared.<strong>How did it go?</strong>In a word, great. One interesting aspect of this, is that course organizers do not get to hear what happens in all the other conversations, so we just have to ask people how they went. I had a very interesting conversation with<a href=""http://metameso.org/~joe/"">Joe Corneli</a> and got some great new ideas, and from what I heard, the other members really liked it too. We asked people to take notes in <a href=""http://pad.p2pu.org/cscl"">the Etherpad</a>, and provided a simple structure (1 realization, 1 unresolved question and 1 idea) for what we wanted to hear.Unfortunately, the meeting got quite truncated because of some confusion about when we were starting, and people having to leave early, so we didn&#039;t have a lot of time to discuss in the group what had been shared in the pairs. In the future, it would be interesting to think of other designs, for example I&#039;d love to first talk to one person for 10 minutes, and then another one for 10 minutes. That way you get to talk to more people, and you can bring ideas from the first conversation into the second one. We could also have people who have read different articles talk, so that they can share what they have read with each other, etc.Of course, there is nothing stopping people from making appointments to calling each other up at any time during the week, and some courses have tried to make this a regular feature, like the first course on creative non-fiction, where people where supposed to team up during the week to critique each other&#039;s writings. However, this is very difficult to schedule, and you lack the flexibility of being able to switch between different people, bring it back to the big group, etc.Would love to hear from others who try this, refine the concept, or have other great ways of conducting synchronous online meetings or study groups!Stian</div>","Etherpad + small groups in Skype, a new way of doing P2PU meetings  Learning Technology => [...] Read [...]. Rebecca Cober => As someone who participated in the PiratePad/Skype meeting, I want to add my impressions here. I thought the organization of the meeting worked well. On the PiratePad, participants wrote which of the two articles they read and recorded their Skype names. Stian quickly paired us up and gave us the following structure: talk about one realization, one unresolved question, and one idea that came from the article.  My partner Marcy and I had a great conversation and found the structure really helpful. The meeting would have been even better if we had had a chance to summarize our conversation for the group, but most people took notes on the pirate pad and those can be reviewed. Perhaps we tried to change topics too quickly to the badge conversation. I think that may have been a little overwhelming for people, as there was a lot of material to go through. It might be an idea to have a separate meeting time for people who are interested in discussing just the badge topic.  It is certainly interesting to think about alternative structures for the meeting. Perhaps, the ""sign-up"" could be posted in advance and people could pair themselves up based on what they have read. Perhaps each pair member could suggest a structure or question for their discussion. . "Conceptually explicit representations for group learning and representational guidance,"academia/research,CSCL-intro,Education,open-education,p2pU,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/05/26/conceptually-explicit-representations-for-group-learning-and-representational-guidance/,"I was very excited when I first came across Dan Suther&#039;s 2008 article [[ref:suthers2008empirical|""Empirical studies of the value of conceptually explicit notations in collaborative learning""]] in the book ""Knowledge Cartography: Software tools and mapping techniques"" (a book which is filled with other very interesting chapters as well). I had been acquainted with Knowledge Forum for several years, and also seen a few other graphical discourse environments, but never had any vocabulary for describing them, or taxonomy for analyzing the design, and how it could impact learning.Suther&#039;s article lays out a whole theory of how graphical discourse systems impact collaborative learning discourses, through the two concepts of salience and constraints, and runs a number of experiments with different systems to show the actual impact of the design changes. This was very refreshing to me, after having read a lot of Knowledge Building literature that mostly acted like the base design of Knowledge Forum was sacred, and never referred to other graphical discourse tools, or experimented with radical changes in the design to see how it impacted the learning process.For <a href=""http://new.p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-the-field-of-computer-supported-co/content/wk-5-design-of-collaborative-learning-environments-representational-guidance-suthers/"">week 5 of CSCL intro</a>, I read both [[ref:suthers2008empirical|Suthers (2008)]], as well as an earlier paper from 2001, [[ref:suthers2001towards|Towards a Systematic Study of Representational Guidance for Collaborative Learning Discourse]], where he laid out his research agenda for the next few years, and touches on more of the theory behind his ideas. I&#039;ve taken quite detailed noted, as usual, so I won&#039;t spend this blog post trying to explain all of his ideas, but rather to bring up some of my questions, or ideas.He cites a lot of interesting papers, and I plan to read many of them in the future - in fact, it&#039;s just this kind of a situation that my wiki was made for. If reading the paper and highlighting / adding notes is first-order processing, and using the sidewiki to synthesis and write organized notes/key ideas is second-order processing, then the third-order is moving the ideas out of the individual article pages. I&#039;d like to have a page, for example, on ""salience"", which integrates the knowledge from all the articles I&#039;ve read (with links back to the individual articles, of course).<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-26-at-8.44.25-PM.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1031"" title=""Screen shot 2011-05-26 at 8.44.25 PM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-26-at-8.44.25-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""425"" /></a><strong>Implementation</strong>Many of Suther&#039;s studies are laboratory studies, where two students sit in a room with one or two computer screens for an hour or two. This is an interesting design which allows him to test a number of different ""configurations"" with a large number of students in a relatively pure environment. However, a two-hour interaction is a poor substitute for a two week class section, or even an entire 12 week course. Even if we accept that certain forms of representational guidance help students think more systematically and deeply about issues, how do we implement them as part of a curriculum - what is the ideal balance between time spent online, time spent face to face (if it is a hybrid class), other instructional activities etc?Suthers mentions two studies (Suthers, Toth &amp; Weiner 1997; Toth et al 2002) which ""developed comprehensive method for implementing Belvedere-supported collaborative inquiry in classroom"", and I look forward to reading them. I also hope to find other studies that can shed light on this issue.<strong>Granularities of collaboration</strong>I&#039;ve previously discussed the idea of granularities of collaboration (<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/04/26/cscl-intro-week-1-constructivism/"">1</a>, <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/05/19/contributions-to-a-theoretical-framework-for-cscl/"">2</a>). In most of the cases that Suthers&#039; experiments with, the granularity of collaboration is extremely low - there are two people who directly interact, and immediately express their ideas, etc. In the asynchronous cases, there might be a little bit more individual processing before posting, but it is still likely to be minimal.However, most courses are not conducted in dyads, what happens when there area many more participants? Perhaps there are sub-groups (as happens naturally when two or more students share computers and work on an artefact, like is common with Knowledge Building)? Or there might go days between each time people contribute, and they might do a substantial amount of processing individually, either in their head (what Suthers calls ""cognitive operations"" from Zhang (2007)), or even externally, taking notes or drawing up a diagram, before posting something to the central artefact (""perceptual operations"").Suthers writes that: ""People construct representations together, elements of the representation becomes imbued with meanings for the participants by virtue of having been produced through the negotiation mentioned above."" This was what prompted my question above - I am thinking of for example people who were unable to participate in an Etherpad meeting, who look through the log and look at the finished artefact. They can still access the same representation, but they don&#039;t have the same shared memory.I wonder if there are ways of overcoming this - Etherpad for example, provides a ""playback mode"", so you can see how the artefact took form (although right now, the chat is not replayed in sync, which would be useful). Or you could even imagine someone doing a screencast with the replay tool, providing a narrative voice-over of how the group arrived at a certain point.(These reflections were also prompted by the fact that I often find diagrams, flowcharts or mind maps in academic articles or blogs very difficult to understand, and often prefer narrative explanations. Clearly, diagrams work very differently if you constructed them yourself, or if you are looking at somebody else&#039;s finished product. )<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-26-at-8.44.12-PM.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1032"" title=""Screen shot 2011-05-26 at 8.44.12 PM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-26-at-8.44.12-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""317"" /></a><strong>Representational guidance literacy</strong>Suthers&#039; (2008) concludes that:System designers should treat representational design as design of resources for conversation between learners.<blockquote>A designer or teacher might ask:<ul><li><div>What activities does a given representational notation suggest or prompt for?</div></li><li><div>Do the actions that can be performed on a shared representation in this notation correspond to the potential ideas that we want learners to negotiate and distinctions we want them to attend to?</div></li><li><div>Do the resulting representations express and make salient the ideas and relationships that learners should revisit and relate to new information?</div></li><li><div>Are the needs that should be addressed by subsequent activity, such the lack of information, made obvious?</div></li><li><div>Do the representations capture important aspects of learners&rsquo; thinking and expose conflicts between alternative solutions or perspectives?</div></li><li><div>Stepping beyond the scope of the studies reported here, one might ask: does the notation provide the preferred vocabularies and representational perspectives that constitute both the target skill to be learned as an aspiring member of a community, and focus learning activity on ways of approaching a problem that are productive?</div></li></ul></blockquote>Does this mean that it would be useful to develop a range of different tools, or even tools that were configurable by teachers, to suit different instructional methods and subject areas? Let&#039;s say a tool that you could easily configure to show node-links, with a chat that was deictically indexed for one task, and for another task, you used Knowledge Forum, for a third task a week later, you used an Excel spreadsheet with theories and proofs on different columns &ndash; this would be a very different approach from the ""one-size-fits-all"" of for example Knowledge Forum.[[ref:gan2010early|Gan (2010)]] suggests that the use of graphical discourse toools, such as Knowledge Forum, can help students gain ""graphical literacy"".<blockquote>Graphical literacy involves a range of visual thinking and communication skills (Jolliffe, 1991) and the ability to use graphic tools to construct, present, read, and interpret charts, maps, graphs, and other visual presentations (e.g., spreadsheets, timelines, cartoons, photographs) that supplement prose in textbooks, nonfiction trade-‐books, and newspapers (Readence, Bean &amp; Baldwin, 2004).Visual thinking is defined as processing information through images or graphics instead of words (Olson, 1992) and graphical representations help support and externalize visual thinking, aiding creative problem solving and intellectual development. Visual thinking is a fundamental and unique part of our perceptual system aiding in the construction of mental models that can lead to productive thinking and learning (West, 1997) and supporting verbal and symbolic forms of expression (McLoughlin &amp; Krakowski, 2001).</blockquote>I wonder if the use of a number of different graphical discourse systems can make students meta-cognitively aware of the salience and constraints of these different systems, and if so, what the effect would be on the learning.This could be furthered by students not only being exposed to these different systems during teacher-initiated group work, but also using various ways of externalizing and systematizing their knowledge individually (mind mapping, etc). Ideally, this would be a skill that students could bring with them throughout life.<strong>Visual salience and cognition</strong>I am fascinated by the distinction between ""direct perception"", which requires automatic computation, but no executive control (such as the color of a node), and other perception, such as whether a node is connected to another node, which requires active visual search. It is a fascinating perspective to use for analyzing different discourse platforms, and also thinking about new ways of representing knowledge (I dream about a room with gigantic touch screens, so that I can put all my different ideas up there, drag them from one room to the next, etc &ndash; there is something very powerful about ""seeing everything"" at the same time).","GroupScribbles and pedagogical patterns | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] This is what Dan Suthers and others have analyzed as &#8220;representational guidance&#8221; (see my blog post about this).

Will we be better off if people think alone and discuss in small groups F2F, and only join the plenary session on the net in special circumstances?

I really wanted the people that had helped me so much, many of whom spoke little or no English, to be able to read my ideas (and I also believe the knowledge that your research participants will read your final product ""keeps you honest""), and I found a translator willing to do it for a relatively low price. Unfortunately, she took very long, and the final quality was not good, so I spent a lot of time redoing the translation.However, I am very happy about the reception the paper has gotten. It has been cited by several blog posts and one article, and I consistently get many more downloads of the Indonesian version, than the English one.An important reason for me wanting to do the translation, apart from a sense of respect towards a country and an academic tradition that I am studying, is my own experience with foreign languages. I can speak Chinese quite fluently, and can happily discuss open education and P2PU for hours over beer and shaokao, however give me a 100 page academic report in Chinese, and what would in English be a quick evening of scanning through and highlighting interesting section turns into a week-long or month-long project. (In fact, that is one of the reasons I am only able to publish the Chinese translation of my thesis now - although my translator was very good, I still wanted to read through the whole thing carefully myself, which took forever).It would surprise me if not many Chinese academics felt the same towards English, which might be why I received a lot of thank you notes from academics whom I shared my English thesis with, but not a single substantial comment on the contents (we will see if the Chinese version changes that at all).It&#039;s a bit weird dipping back into my MA research, since I am now head-long into my PhD research, which although still about open resources and open learning, goes in a very different direction. However, I am still hoping to collaborate with some Chinese academics to get an article or two published in Chinese journals, and I still owe my supervisor an article for an English-language journal, so I am not quitefinished with this project yet.I want to thank <a href=""mailto:hongrui241@qq.com"">Zhong Hongrui</a> for the incredibly careful and thorough work he did with the translation.

We were also supposed to read an article by Slotta, but that link seems to have gone broken. The Puntambekar paper was a great read though, and a very nice introduction to the idea of scaffolding.<strong>Historical background</strong>I have frequently heard the words scaffolding in connection with [[Knowledge Forum]], and had some understanding of its current use, but did not know about its history, or about some of the critiques of its current use. Apparently ""scaffolding"" was first used about the interaction between parent-child or teacher-student, related to Vygotsky&#039;s Zone of Proximal Development (I had heard about ZPD, but never connected it with scaffolds).At this point, scaffolds had several important features that seemed to get lost in the move to group learning and automated scaffolding:<ul><li>the shared understanding of the learning task by the adult and the child</li><li>the dialogic interaction between the two</li><li>the scaffold being adapted continually to fit the child&#039;s zone of proximal development</li><li>the adult being both a general facilitator and a domain-expert</li><li>the scaffold eventually fading away, and transferring the responsibility to the child</li></ul>Both scaffolds (for construction) and support structures under arches are proposed as metaphors in the article, but I wonder if support-wheels for children learning to bike aren&#039;t more appropriate - they let you do something you wouldn&#039;t be able to do otherwise, and practice other skills, but it&#039;s a great day when you can take them off and go much faster.<strong>Scaffolds in group learning</strong>CSCL is all about group learning, not the individual teacher-student relationships (although much good can be said about that as well). In larger groups, it becomes much harder to make the scaffold adapted to each child, although some ways are suggested - one is to give the individual learners more control over when to remove the scaffold (for example by a button saying ""Don&#039;t remind me about this anymore""), and something called ""learner models"" are also mentioned. I read a few articles about this - the idea is that given your interactions with the computer, the computer develops an internal model of what you know, or what your skills are, and is able to adapt the learning environment based on this.However, this latter is usually found in the literature on intelligent tutors, which are not constructivist at all - something like Carnegie Mellon&#039;s Open Learning Initiative, for example. I&#039;ve always wondered if it were possible to have learner models in a constructivist collaborative setting.I also wonder to what extent scaffolding and zone of proximal development presumes an ""encyclopedic"" perspective on knowledge - given that the adult is supposed to also be a domain expert, who leads the child to the knowledge. This might not fit well with messy problems, but I guess the adult can still model the kind of critical thinking and inquiry that he/she wants the child to emulate, without necessarily knowing all the answers the child will come up with?<strong>Scaffolding and scripting</strong>There are a number of words used frequently, which are often hard to define. In many of the cases mentioned in this article, scaffolding seems very similar to what I understand as ""scripting"" (especially when Puntambekar says that the software can help with the ""procedural scaffolding"" so that the adults can focus on the ""cognitive scaffolding"").Perhaps scripting is even defined as one kind of a scaffold, although I&#039;ve never seen that mentioned anywhere. I&#039;ll need to do more reading to see. (I recently read Wecker, et al.&#039;s [[ref:wecker2010scol|""S-COL: A Copernican turn for the development of flexibly reusable collaboration scripts""]], which was a nice introduction to scripting).I also see the word <em>orchestration</em> used, and am not sure how that fits in. Again, more reading required.<strong>Scaffolding in Knowledge Forum</strong>It&#039;s interesting to think about how scaffolding works in Knowledge Forum, given the criticism raised in this article. Scaffolds are definitively ""one-size-fits-all"", and there is no mechanisms for fading them out, nor have I seen any mention in any of Scardamalia&#039;s articles of a desire to gradually ""wean"" students off these scaffolds.I wonder if there is a difference between scaffolds and things that simply help you do your thinking better - for example, I could create a template for notes on articles in my wiki, prompting me to answer certain questions, etc. This could by some be described as a scaffold, but I would have no strong need to ""overcome it"", and internalize it - it&#039;s simply another knowledge management tool.Many other interesting things brought up in this article too - the link with Skinnerian behaviourism, the difference between peer-facilitation and expert-facilitation, etc. I have already downloaded several of the referenced articles.","CSCL-intro the Bi-Weekly #10 | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] summarized the article, and blogged about it.

We are still waiting to confirm, but hopefully he will be able to join us at our normal meeting time on Saturday.StianPS: Happy <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duanwu_Festival"">Duanwu Festival</a>, which we celebrated by making dumplings with a local family.",GCCCE 2011 in Hangzhou,"academia/research,china,CSCL-intro,Education,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/06/07/gccce-2011-in-hangzhou/,"<img class=""size-full wp-image-1058"" title=""Screen shot 2011-06-07 at 6.32.45 PM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-07-at-6.32.45-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""68"" />Last week, I went to Hangzhou to participate in the Global Chinese Conference on Computers in Education (GCCCE). Hangzhou is a beautiful city, where I once spent half a year, and I was looking forward to a chance to go back. The registration fee for the conference was also quite reasonable, only $75 for students, and I wanted a bit of a chance from the village life. The trip began with waving down a bus going to Xi&#039;an from the side of the highway that passes by close to the village where I am staying. Three hours later, I got there, had some noodles (they had hot dry noodles - which this blog is named after (reganmian), something you almost never see outside Wuhan!).Then on to a sleeper train for a 24 hour trip to Hangzhou. They had trains that only needed 18 hours, but the tickets were sold out (and soon, they will probably have high-speed trains that make the distance in much less). It was reasonably uneventful, I read on my Kindle for most of the distance, until a little child was walking on the platform during a stop-over, and fell through the gap between the train and the platform. It was quite dramatic, while the mother was lowered down on the platform to retrieve him through a service entrance.I got to Hangzhou, and went to the hotel to register. There I was very happy to run into <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pub/yibing-zhang/21/9b4/844"">Zhang Yibing</a>, a professor at Nanjing University who spent time in Toronto as a visiting scholar. He invited me along with some colleagues to the famous West Lake for some green tea, and we had very nice discussions about his work on adapting [[Knowledge Forum]] to be used in local schools.Although I have participated in some international conferences in China before (including OpenCourseWare Consortium 2008 in Dalian), and some workshops and meetings, I&#039;d never participated in a full-blown peer-reviewed conference all in Chinese. And this was also a ""global"" Chinese conference, which meant that many of the presenters were from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and even the US.Attending any conference is always quite exhausting - a never-ending parade of 15-minute presentations on new topics, often by people who are not very good at public speaking, and are eager to get through all the minute details of their research in the allotted time. Add to that the fact that it was all in Chinese, often in ""interesting"" dialects, and many times with slides in traditional characters, and I was completely worn out by the end of the two days.I did [[gccce11:notes|take notes]] on some of the presentations I attended - some of these are quite minimal, because I sometimes began to take notes, and then realized that the contents were not very relevant to my interests, or I was simply too tired to continue.The quality was quite varying. There were some excellent presentations on the one hand, and some incredibly simplistic ones (using 15 minutes to explain how to use basic internet technologies, for example), and everything in between.[[gccce11:nancy_law_keynote|Nancy Law]] from HKU presented on sustainable technological innovation, with many examples from Hong Kong and around the world. A very important point for those of us who wish to see the good practices and software innovations that come out of our research be widely implemented in schools and school districts. [[gccce11:yang_keynote|Yang Zongkai]] introduced the national education plan, which I have mentioned here <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/02/28/key-numbers-from-chinas-2010-2020-education-plan/"">before</a>. He was one of the people involved in writing it, and in a very good position to explain it (and the process of writing it). He underlined the importance of a whole chapter being devoted to educational technology, however the plan is so detailed, that his speech became a very high-level fly-over.[[gccce11:wang_keynote|Gwo-Jen Hwang]] from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology had a very engaging and humorous keynote about the research and experimentation his lab has done around ubiquitous and mobile learning. Lot&#039;s of great examples, highlighted with video clips. Unfortunately I could not find any of these videos on his website, but he has a long list of <a href=""http://cctsai.net/gjhwang/publish.htm"">publications</a>.Some of the presentations were highly technical, and did not so much focus on the pedagogical aspects of how their technical innovations could be used, for example [[gccce11:cai_su|Cai Su]]&#039;s 3D environments, and [[gccce11:sun_maoyuan|Sun Maoyuan]]&#039;s semantic intelligent question answering system.Probably the most interesting presentation was by [[gccce11:chen_wenli|Chen Wenli]] from Singapore&#039;s National Institute of Education, who presented on a tool called [[GroupScribbles]], and what she called ""Rapid Knowledge Building"". The tool looks really interesting, and I am planning to read some of the articles about it, and blog more about it (unfortunately, it only seems to run on Windows, so I won&#039;t be able to easily try it out on my Mac).I am vegetarian, and although they almost always have food I can eat at Chinese restaurants, they still think of meat as ""higher status"", and sometimes it can be hard to find vegetable dishes at ""fancy"" occasions, like weddings or banquets. Imagine my surprise when I asked whether there would be any vegetarian dishes, and was told that there was a special table for vegetarians! I ended up having very nice dinners both days with a group of Taiwanese researchers (not a single mainland person at the table), many of whom were Buddhist. This only strengthens my wish to visit Taiwan sometime soon.All in all, an interesting event, and a great warm-up for <a href=""http://www.isls.org/cscl2011"">CSCL 2011</a> in Hong Kong next month.Stian",Nelson Liu => I am ready to as your city tour guide about Taipei.. GroupScribbles and pedagogical patterns,"CSCL-intro,Education,open-education,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/06/09/groupscribbles-and-pedagogical-patterns/,"One of the presentations that impressed me at the recent GCCCE 2011 was by [[Chen Wenli]] on using [[GroupScribbles]] for language learning. To be honest, I was more fascinated by the tool, than by the exact way in which she had used it.This is a good example of how you the way you read an article changes dependent on your existing knowledge - a constructivist epistemology. My history professor in high school used to say that a historian read the first or second history book about a topic to find out ""what happened"", and he/she reads more history books to find out ""how are people describing what happened.As I began looking up this tool, which was first developed by <a href=""http://www.sri.com/"">SRI</a>, and later taken over by the <a href=""http://lsl.nie.edu.sg"">Learning Sciences Lab</a> at Singapore&#039;s National Institute of Education, I found that a number of articles had been written about it. Reading the first article, I was very interested in the specific design of the tool, but on reading more articles, I already knew that, and could skip those parts (checking if there was anything new), and go to the way they had used it.<img class=""alignleft"" src=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/_media/skim:chen2009integrating0.png"" alt="""" width=""323"" height=""209"" />The tool itself is quite simple - there is an upper and a lower frame. In the lower frame is an inexhaustible supply of ""post-it notes"", which can be written on, drawn upon, etc. By dragging a note up to the upper pane, the note automatically becomes public and shared with everyone else (in the group or in the classroom).The entire upper pane is shared, so anyone can drag notes around, and even take a note written by someone else down to their personal space (it then disappears from the public view), and for example attach a note, before they drag it back.[[ref:digiano2006learning|DiGiano, Tatar and Kireyev (2006)]] describe the advantages of physical post-it notes for meeting coordination:<ul><li><div>representationally neutral</div></li><li><div>capture diagrams and drawings, as well as text</div></li><li><div>different sizes affords different kinds of activities</div></li><li><div>informal - better suited to quick sketches than highly finished ideas</div></li><li><div>meta-informatic (can annotate other representations, including other post-its)</div></li><li><div>rearrangable, position and reposition to convey meaning</div></li><li><div>unique - can only be one place at one time</div></li><li>shareable - many can interact with it</li></ul>However, there are also problems with physical post-it notes:<div><ul><li><div>size is static - can&#039;t zoom in, view from distance</div></li><li><div>unique - can&#039;t have in two different places</div></li><li><div>doesn&#039;t scale - too many people, etc</div></li><li><div>hard to archive/publish result of post-it activity</div></li></ul></div><img class=""alignleft"" src=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/_media/ideas:visual010.png"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""322"" />GroupScribbles was designed to preserve most of the good features, while alleviating many of the problems.I was very excited to see a CSCL tool whose design explicitly referenced how we conduct workshops, because I have myself written about this previously, thinking that there were strong similarities and overlaps between these two domains, in [[Grappling with ideas]].Here I will discuss a few of the ""affordances"" of GroupScribbles, and post-it notes, more in detail.<strong>Informal</strong>Above, it was listed that post-it notes were informal, and were more suited to quick sketches than to detailed designs. [[ref:roschelle2007ink|Roschelle et. al (2007)]] refer to Socrates&#039; drawing a sketch in the sand, and list the following advantages of informal sketching:<ul><li><div>more expressive of key concepts than a neat, chiseled presentation</div></li><li><div>informal sketch better invites participation of student in active reasoning, compare to formal diagram</div></li><li><div>act of drawing, gesturing and speaking in close synchrony let&#039;s him focus student&#039;s attention of meaning</div></li><li><div>by asking probing questions, learns about student&#039;s state of knowledge, adaptability of instruction</div></li></ul><strong>Low tool specificity</strong>As[[ref:digiano2006learning|DiGiano, Tatar and Kireyev (2006)]] points out, in choosing tools to support individual and collective intelligence, there are two different choices. The first is to think carefully about how to design the tool so that it can provide support for explicit group processes. This is what Dan Suthers and others have analyzed as ""representational guidance"" (see <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/05/26/conceptually-explicit-representations-for-group-learning-and-representational-guidance/"">my blog post about this</a>). This is a very powerful idea, that I find very attractive. However, another approach is to use ""light-weight tools that support multi-faceted interactions with emergent conventions"".From what I understand, that&#039;s what David Jonassen argues in his book about mind tools (which I have not read yet). These sticky notes are also an example of this - of course, there are some clear attributes, as seen above, and they clearly favor one kind of notes (sketchy, brief sentences) over another (formalized, long narratives, elaborate illustrations and designs). However, you can write what you want to, place them where you want, you do not need to choose a certain size of post-it for a certain kind of idea, or label explicit links between them etc. You just write what comes to mind, moves them around till a pattern emerges. There is something powerful and liberating to this as well.<strong>Coordination</strong>[[ref:roschelle2007ink|Roschelle et. al (2007)]] emphasizes the important role GroupScribbles can play in coordinating collaborative activity. They compare it to existing student response systems (a new category to me), such as clickers, or [[Classroom Presenter]], which also uses tablet PCs, but do not enable the students to take any active role in coordination - it is all centrally coordinated by the teacher. In contrast, GroupScribbles, because of the ability of students to take notes into their private space, move them together in the collective space, etc, allows quite sophisticated social learning scripts, while freeing the teacher from spending too much time coordinating. This can be seen from the [[ref:roschelle2007ink#teaching_patterns|scripts listed in Roschelle]], and [[ref:debarger2010teaching#scripts|Debarger]]<strong></strong><strong>Others</strong>Other things that were mentioned were playfulness and fun (without the problem with coordination, as mentioned above). <a href=""http://reganmian.net/monica/csclintro/groupscribbles-for-quick-and-anonymous-knowledge-building/"">Monica wrote</a> about an article I didn&#039;t read, and mentioned anonymity as a big thing - this is a very interesting concept to think about. [[:ref:debarger2010teaching|Debarger, et al.]] have also done very interesting work on learning patterns, adaptible teaching, and formative assessment.<strong>Conclusion</strong>A very interesting tool, and some very insightful articles. It was quite interesting reading a number of articles about the same tool, but from very different perspectives &ndash; and then reading a blog post by Monica about another article I hadn&#039;t read. I would love to play with it (but it seems to only be for Windows), or at least see it in use (I didn&#039;t find any videos of it).Stian&nbsp;",Participation statistics of CSCL intro,"academia/research,CSCL-intro,Education,open-education,p2pU,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/06/20/participation-statistics-of-cscl-intro/,"<strong>The course</strong><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-8.16.33-PM.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1092"" title=""Screen shot 2011-06-20 at 8.16.33 PM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-8.16.33-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""409"" /></a>During the past eight weeks, <a href=""http://reganmian.net/monica"">Monica Resendes</a> and I facilitated <a href=""http://p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-the-field-of-computer-supported-co/"">a course</a> called ""Introduction to the field of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning"" on <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">P2PU</a>. We are both interested in developing a research agenda around open courses, although this first course did not have an explicit research design or research questions. We approached it as a ""baseline"", to get an idea of how it is to facilitate courses on P2PU, and also to try out some ideas regarding design and organization.I can certainly say that I learnt a huge amount from the course, both from the actual content of course (all the course participants were scarily brilliant, lot&#039;s of great insights in the blog posts and discussions!), and from the experience of facilitating the course in itself. Having been so close to the runnings of P2PU from the very beginning, and having worked closely with many course organizers, I was actually surprised at how much I learnt - but I did. Being a course organizer yourself is a whole different experience.Part of it is the change of focus. Earlier, I thought of technical changes in terms of all the different courses, how much support it would need, how much in demand a feature was etc. But when you are a course organizer, you have laser-focus on your own course, and what it needs. And you&#039;ve spent a lot of time developing the ideas, imagining a vision of how the course will go, etc. (Of course, it becomes interesting when this vision is not the same as the students&#039; vision of how the course should run, which I will blog about later).<strong>Lessons learnt</strong>Anyway, last week the course ended, and now we are thinking about what we have learnt. We posted five simple questions for all the active participants:<ul><li>What was the best thing about this course?</li><li>Did you learn anything that will help you in your job or studies?</li><li>Approximately how much time did you spend on the course each week?</li><li>How should we improve the organization of the course in the future?</li><li>How could the different tools and communication channels work better?</li></ul>and we&#039;ve got some great answers in <a href=""http://p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-the-field-of-computer-supported-co/content/wk8-final-week-course-wrap-up-reflection"">this thread</a>, and Martin also replied on <a href=""http://kaffeikampala.blogspot.com/2011/06/intro-to-cscl.html"">his blog</a>.<strong>Participation</strong><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/people.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1086"" title=""people"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/people.png"" alt="""" width=""302"" height=""343"" /></a>Monica and I are planning to do more analysis of the participation patterns etc, and we are currently preparing a survey to send out to ""followers"", but I did a quick count of participation statistics for the people who signed up to ""participate"" in the course.Of 13 participants (plus Monica and I, who also participated actively in all activities, but whom I have not included in these statistics), there were two whom we never heard from again after they were admitted to the course (one of whom has not done anything else on P2PU either, the single item in their activity feed is being admitted to the course). Apart from those two, a further five students ""left us"" during the first few weeks (one actually posted a message stating that she was not able to keep up due to other commitments, the others just ""faded away"").<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-8.14.41-PM.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1090"" title=""Screen shot 2011-06-20 at 8.14.41 PM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-8.14.41-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""289"" height=""218"" /></a>That left us with six students who were fairly active, and committed to the very end. Together with the course organizers, the eight of us have become a pretty tight-knit community, and really enjoyed the ride together. We&#039;ve participated in different ways, one was never able to make the Saturday group chats, whereas most of the others did, some have used the forums on P2PU actively, others preferred their own blog, one never blogged, but made every single group meeting, etc. But they were all fairly active almost every week of the course, from the start to the end.I know this is a very simplified analysis, but it also correlates with what I experienced (although going back to look at the data was useful - some of the people who signed up but never showed up, I had kind of forgotten about, but I had also forgotten about some of the people that were active during week one or two, but then faded out).<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-8.04.24-PM.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1089"" title=""Screen shot 2011-06-20 at 8.04.24 PM"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-8.04.24-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""319"" height=""237"" /></a>I am really grateful that we were able to finish strong (almost everyone made it to an amazing meeting in week 7 with guest speaker <a href=""http://www.upei.ca/~amcauley/"">Sandy McAuley</a>, and again to the last meeting this weekend, and every single person of those eight has posted a reflection on the five questions we asked them). I really didn&#039;t want this course to slowly fade out. While we are all discussing interesting ways of carrying the course community forwards, including creating a sort of CSCL ""book-club"", it&#039;s valuable to have some kind of ""closure"" for our experience together these eight weeks.However, I would of course have loved to see more of the about 50% of people who didn&#039;t ""complete"" the course engage more actively. I myself was absent from the course for almost two weeks due to travel and an eye infection, and experienced how hard it was to ""reinsert myself"" into the community. At that time, I wrote to several students who had not been active, and encouraged them in a non-judgmental way to ""get back on the train"". I received several positive responses to that message, but nobody actually did.I&#039;ve also written to all the participants who have yet to post reflections, and asked them to do so - even for people who were not active at all, I&#039;d love to hear their thoughts. Or - if someone was reading a lot, but never posted, that&#039;s also very valuable information.<strong>The future?</strong>Any lessons for the future? Well, although I did <a href=""http://p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-the-field-of-computer-supported-co/content/how-to-participate-in-this-class-2/"">make it quite explicit</a> what kind of participation I expected of ""core participants"", there was no way of linking to this from the sign-up page, when the course was getting started, so I had no guarantee of students having read it. (I really hope this will be fixed before I run another course). I&#039;m also thinking that perhaps next time, I will make the sign-up question a bit ""harder"" - not in terms of difficulty, but in terms of engagement. For example, by asking students to read one article, and post some thoughts about it on their blog. That way, they have to do something a lot more active than just clicking ""subscribe"", and two sentences about their interest, and I&#039;ll already have their blog URLs.On the other hand, there were 7 people who applied to the course and did not provide enough information. I asked them to do so, but they never responded. (It&#039;s possible that they did not receive the notification). Perhaps if I had let some of them in, they would have gotten interested, and would have participated more than some of the people who did get in... Given that participation beyond week 1 was such a strong measure of completion, perhaps we should do like undergraduate classes, which let almost anyone sign up for the first two weeks, and then kick people out who are not active enough.Of course, I could just open enrolment to anyone - and indeed, maybe the active group had settled on being exactly the same. I still think there is a value to having a small group of people who make an explicit commitment to learning together over a certain period of time, but I certainly don&#039;t think it&#039;s the only way to do things.Stian","Interview with a CSCL Intro follower/lurker | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] every week, post on your own blog and participate in the weekly meetings.

I was very excited, since I had been reading papers by many of the people who would be attending, and it would also be the first time I&#039;d be in Hong Kong (and later China) with my supervisor, and people from my university.Although the <a href=""http://www.isls.org/cscl2011/conf-overview.htm"">actual core conference</a>only lasts for a few days, I began my participation with two days of pre-conferences, attended post-conference events in both Guangzhou and Beijing, and even the doctoral summer school in Beijing that was affiliated with the conference. Thus, my earliest notes are from [[cscl11:leveraging_tool_support_for_the_analysis_of_computer-mediated_activities|the pre-conference on machine learning and data analysis on July 4th]], and my latest ones from [[a:Gerry Stahl|Gerry Stahl&#039;s]][[cscl11:past_present_and_future_of_research_on_educational_technology_in_the_west|talk to the international summer school on July 18th]].However, there were of course sessions I did not capture notes for. Taking detailed notes is exhaustive, and it&#039;s difficult to do it the entire day. This is added to mundane issues like finding power outlets, etc. Either way, I hope the notes might be helpful - they certainly are to me. <strong>[[cscl11:start|Overview over all notes.]]</strong>The [[cscl11:leveraging_tool_support_for_the_analysis_of_computer-mediated_activities|first pre-conference]] which I mentioned above was organized by [[a:Carolyn Penstein Rose|Carolyn Penstein Ros]] and her post-doc [[a:Gregory Dyke|Gregory Dyke]], and discussed tools to analyze computer-mediated communications. We got training in using [[t:Tatiana|Tatiana]], a tool to analyze synchronous events with time-coded data from multiple media (for example videos, transcripts, chat and a shared whiteboard). In the afternoon, we learnt to use SIDE, which is a GUI for a machine-learning framework. Although nobody can become an expert in machine-learning in one afternoon, it was a great overview of the state of the art of machine learning, giving you a sense of what kinds of problems machine learning might be appropriate for. (For people interested in ML, [@mclaren2010supporting] is a great paper showing how ML can be applied to a specific educational challenge, and the thinking that went in to choosing the right algorithm).The [[cscl11:connecting_levels_of_learning_in_networked_communities|second pre-conference]] was about connecting levels of learning, organized by [[:a:Daniel D. Suthers|Dan Suthers]], [[:a:Christopher Teplovs|Chris Teplovs]], [[:a:Marten de Laat|Marten de Laat]], Jun Oshima and Sam Zeini. I&#039;ve read about these ideas before, in[@suthers2010framework], and found them interesting, but quite complex. In this workshop, Gerry Stahl gave a great historical/philosophical overview over CSCL as a discipline, and Dan Suthers presented on their theoretical approach. Then, a few datasets had been shared between researchers who provided different analyses of them - very interesting (although not always easy to tie back to the original theoretical framework of the session).[[cscl11:Ed Chi|Ed Chi]] from Google Research opened the conference with an interesting keynote on augmented social cognition, with several neat cases from his work with access to huge data sets. From the conference sessions, I managed to capture two very interesting sessions on technology-enhanced interactions &amp; analysis ([[cscl11:technology-enhanced_interactions_analysis|1]], [[cscl11:technology-enhanced_interactions_analysis_ii|2]]), and one [[cscl11:mupemure|session on MUPEMURE]], a ""Model of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning with Multiple Representations"".There were some very interesting presentations about the future of Knowledge Forum in the Guangzhou post-conference, which I did not manage to capture (but check out these slides <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/cscl-benefitssymposium-genericimprovements"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/houshuang/building-next-generation-knowledge-building-environments"">2</a>). I did get some notes from two of Gerry Stahl&#039;s presentations, one [[cscl11:cscl-_two_case_studies|describing two case study analyses he did]], and one on [[cscl11:past_present_and_future_of_research_on_educational_technology_in_the_west|the history and future of CSCL]].I&#039;m looking forward to <a href=""http://www.isls.org/icls2012/"">the International Conference on Learning Sciences next year in Sydney</a>(CSCL and ICLS alternate every other year), where I hop to present a paper on open learning environments.

This would function similar to Twitter, where you can follow anyone without needing their permission (different from Facebook, where friending is reciprocal), and receive their updates.Thus, when we launched our course called ""<a href=""http://p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-the-field-of-computer-supported-co/content/full-description/"">Introduction to Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning</a>"" on P2PU this spring, we explicitly offered <a href=""http://p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-the-field-of-computer-supported-co/content/how-to-participate-in-this-class-2/"">two different modes of participation</a>. You could <a href=""http://p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-the-field-of-computer-supported-co/sign-up/"">apply</a> to be a core member, and be expected to do the readings every week, post on your own blog and participate in the weekly meetings. I have blogged about the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/06/20/participation-statistics-of-cscl-intro/"">participation statistics</a>of the core members earlier.<strong>How did following work in our course?</strong>However, many people might be interested in the course topic, yet not have enough time (or inclination) to commit to being an active member. These people could ""follow"" the course. People added themselves as followers throughout the course, and currently we have about 50 people signed up. We were very curious about their experience of the course. Our course launched at the same time as the new platform, so it is natural to assume that some of the followers were just trying out new functionality. Others might have used it as an internal bookmark, reminding themselves to go back in the future. Did anyone actually actively follow along and get something meaningful out of the course?(Part of the problem with evaluating this, is that the website was under rapid development, and a lot of new functionality was added as the course was running. Initially, followers did not receive any e-mail updates. About mid-ways, they began receiving updates that course organizers marked as ""important"" (typically the bi-weekly updates). In the future, followers will probably have the same choices of e-mail notifications as course participants, which might significantly change how they interact with courses they follow).<strong>Survey of followers</strong>We had hoped to see our course ""amplified"" through our followers, with retweets and blogs about topics they found interesting. There was, however, very little evidence of this. There was some retweeting and mentioning in blogs, but this was mainly along existing individual social networks. Thus, hearing nothing from the followers, it was hard to guess whether they were getting anything out of the course. So we decided to design a simple survey (see [[analysis of cscl-intro#followers|the questions we asked]]).We got about 10 answers, which was more than I had hoped for, given that the followers were by definition not very active (some of them might even have left the P2PU platform altogether). Some said they had signed up, but never had time to look, some were planning to go back and review the material later, and some said they had popped in once in a while, and gotten a bit out of it. But one person stood out, professing a lot of enthusiasm, and answering ""10"", where we asked students to rate how much they&#039;d learnt from 1-10. I was very intrigued and e-mailed him, to see if I could ask him some more questions. He gracefully agreed to let me do a short e-mail interview, and post it here.This is interesting not only to get a novel perspective on ""following"", which is a rather new feature on the P2PU website, but also because the subject of ""lurking"" has caused quite a bit of debate in the MOOCosphere (<a href=""http://connect.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=44245"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.danpontefract.com/?p=659"">2</a>, <a href=""http://www.danpontefract.com/?p=671"">3</a>, 4, <a href=""http://ilenef.blogspot.com/2010/12/lurkers-as-consumers-vs-producers.html"">5</a>, <a href=""http://connect.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=44309"">6</a>, <a href=""http://myfirstmooc.blogspot.com/2011/07/am-i-lurker.html"">7</a>for a random selection).One of the things that especially struck me by his answers was how the concept of ""eight weeks"" for the course has little meaning to a follower. I do believe that having a cohort (like <a href=""http://mikecaulfield.com/2009/01/09/rise-of-the-cohort-educational-and-otherwise/"">Mike Caulfield talks about</a>) moving through a set learning trajectory together can be very powerful, but that doesn&#039;t mean that the course materials (the initial ones, and the generated discussion) is worthless once the course is ""over""... And one of the things I am thinking about right now, is to how to better present all the great resources that were generated during the course to new visitors - currently you need to dig around a bit to find the gems.&nbsp;<hr /><strong><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1123"" title=""IMG0130A"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IMG0130A2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""200"" height=""150"" />Who are you? Where do you live, what do you do?</strong><strong></strong>My name is <a href=""http://p2pu.org/en/D.Marcell"">Daniel Marcell Gngora Flores</a>, I live in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Paz"">La Paz</a>, Bolivia, I am an Electronics Engineering student at <a href=""http://www.umsa.bo/"">Universidad Mayor de San Andrs</a>.Currently, I am working on my undergraduate thesis project, a Virtual Control Systems Laboratory based on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furuta_pendulum"">Furuta pendulum</a> for experimentation under the Computer Supported Collaborative Learning approach.<strong>How did you first hear about P2PU, how long have you been involved, what has your experience been, have you taken any other courses, etc.</strong>Since I found MIT&rsquo;s OpenCourseWare, I started looking for open educational resources in order to be a competitive student today and a competitive professional tomorrow.I remember reading a blog post about a &ldquo;<a href=""https://drumbeat.org/en-US/projects/school-of-webcraft/description/"">School of Webcraft</a>&rdquo; that somehow was related to Mozilla. That was enough for me to look for more information, and that is how I arrived at the P2PU web site.I first took a course called &ldquo;<a href=""http://archive.p2pu.org/general/algority-estructuras-de-datos"">Algoritmos y estructuras de datos</a>&rdquo;(Algorithms and Data Structures). I quited after 4 or 5 weeks. Then, I took a course called &ldquo;<a href=""http://p2pu.org/en/groups/getting-started-with-scilab/"">Getting started with Scilab</a>&rdquo;, I did not quit this time just because I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to do it. Why I quit? Despite the course organizers effort, I was not really comfortable with the teacher-student method and I didn&rsquo;t have much time to do the tasks due to work in the first course (there was not a &ldquo;follower&rdquo; type of student at that time), in the second one I felt that I was reading another Scilab tutorial, nothing new, no activities to encourage discussion nor active participation.I was not happy with the courses, but how to organize a course so that the participants become real participants and not only receivers?<strong>How did you hear about the CSCL course</strong>With the arrival of the new P2PU web site, I started browsing the courses almost every week. One day I found a course called &ldquo;Introduction to the field of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning&rdquo;. At that time, I didn&rsquo;t knew anything about CSCL. Nevertheless, it being such an active course, I decided to follow it.<strong>What made you interested?</strong>Once I started reading the course material, I realized that CSCL was about learning through social interaction. Reading about that simple idea was such an eye opening experience to me, because I was used to learning by myself. Thanks to the Open Educational Resources, I was able to fill the spaces and connect the dots in my head without needing a teacher neither a partner. Now, it seems there is another way, a very interesting one.<strong>Why did you decide to follow the course instead of participating</strong>So, participating is the way to go. Being an active participant is how I will learn more. However, there was a problem: my English level. I am still building my English skills, the language barrier was stopping me from participating in this course because I was not able to participate in the chat rooms nor to write weekly blog posts in English, Spanish being my mother tongue. That&rsquo;s why I became a peripheral learner.<strong>What did you expect when you chose to follow the course - what did you think it meant?</strong>I did not expect to find the topic of my undergraduate thesis project by just following the course, but I did (at least in some sense). Given that this was the first time I &ldquo;heard&rdquo; this term, my very first reaction was to look for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-supported_collaborative_learning"">CSCL in Wikipedia</a> to try to understand what was this about.<strong>How was your experience of following the course? During the eight weeks, what was your involvement - what part of the material or conversation did you look at, how much time did you spend, what was useful or interesting to you?</strong>Being a follower, a peripheral learner, to talk about &ldquo;the eight weeks&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t make much sense because I am/was free to read the material (papers, wiki entries, blog posts, chat logs, etc.) at my own pace, whenever I wanted to. In fact, I&rsquo;m still reading the material from week 4.This is important to me because I am a engineering student, and even if I had read some papers related to education, I don&rsquo;t have the background necessary in some cases to understand the material.I could not say exactly how many hours I spend reading the course materials. However, the amount of time I spend reading the material is increasing significantly every week.That being said, I always find it interesting reading wiki entries because of the references. Also, I found the blog posts and the chat logs very valuablebecause reading those made me feel part of the group, a group of people hungry for knowledge. I must admit that I&rsquo;m a little bit jealous, because for me it&rsquo;s hard to find people willing to learn and share their opinions in my &ldquo;environment&rdquo;. I think that this is a direct consequence of the commercialization of education here in Bolivia. A large number of friends of mine, students and professionals, think that what really matters is to have a really big CV filled with &ldquo;n&rsquo;importe quoi&rdquo; instead of looking for opportunities to grow up. Filling the wallet is their final goal.To me, the only way to improve education in Bolivia is applying collaborative learning and using open educational resources. Specially when the University teachers in particular and the educational institutions in general are not committed with this important role.",ICETC in Changchun: International conferences in China,"academia/research,china,events,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/08/09/icetc-in-changchun-international-conferences-in-china/,"<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-Shot-2011-08-09-at-18.20.26-.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1143"" title=""Screen Shot 2011-08-09 at 18.20.26"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-Shot-2011-08-09-at-18.20.26-.png"" alt="""" width=""410"" height=""109"" /></a>While in Hong Kong attending [[cscl11:start|CSCL]], I was surprised to receive an invitiation by Professor <a href=""http://www.nenu.edu.cn/professor/pro/show.php?id=847"">Li Luyi</a> at <a href=""http://en.nenu.edu.cn/"">Northwestern Normal University</a> in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changchun"">Changchun</a> to give <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/08/09/open-courses-and-informal-learning-in-a-web-2-0-world-a-research-agenda/"">a keynote lecture</a> at the upcoming <a href=""http://www.icetc.org/"">International Conference on Educational Technology and Computer</a>. Since I would be participating in the Beijing post-conference and doctoral summer school at the same time, I initially thought that it would not be possible, but we were able to arrange it in the end.<strong>The conference</strong>I would have loved to see more of Changchun, but it was a short visit. I landed in Changchun late in the evening, gave my keynote the next morning, and attended the conference during the day. I just had time to attend part of the banquet in the evening, before I was whisked back to the airport. I don&#039;t think I have ever flown somewhere for less than 24 hours, but despite the short time, the conference was full of interesting people and experiences.The morning begun with myself, <a href=""http://qywang.pbworks.com/w/page/4228790/FrontPage"">Dr. Wang Qiyun</a>from the National Institute of Education in Singapore, and a professor from Bangkok giving our keynote presentations. We went back for the hotel for lunch, and then to another campus for the individual conference presentations.<strong>Quality and pressure</strong>China is pushing hard to expand both the ""objective"" quality of its academic output, and its academic standing in the world. Part of this process is attracting international conferences to China, and encouraging Chinese academics to publish in international journals, or present at international conferences. Often this pressure can be very strong, whether in the form of refusing any MA student to graduate, who doesn&#039;t have a certain number of publications, or offering monetary compensation, sometimes equivalent to several years&#039; of salary, for a single publication in a prestigious international journal.Some international journals prey on this pressure, offering easy publication with a steep publishing fee. Given the low price of publishing a poor quality online-only publication, most of the author-fee is considered profit, while the Chinese researcher gets a publication to list on their CV. The difficulty for many universities and department heads to sort out which international journals are reputable might be what has lead to the ""cargo cult"" around SSCI and SCI rankings - this means everything to Chinese academics, and they are often incredulous when I tell them that Western researchers might not be aware of which specific journals are or are not listed on the SSCI index.The ICETC conference also showed some of these tensions. The conference had received many hundred submissions, and accepted more than 400 papers, which had all been printed in a gigantic proceedings (luckily, we did not receive a hardcopy each). However, many of the participants were quite happy to pay the few hundred yuan participation fee, and have their paper appear in the proceedings, so they did not show up for the actual conference. In fact, after lunch, when I was asked to chair a session, only four presenters out of 24 on the program showed up to present.Of these, the quality was quite poor, and one had not even been aware that he would need to present his paper.<strong>Internationality</strong><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1138"" style=""border-style: initial; border-color: initial;"" title=""Screen Shot 2011-08-09 at 12.41.57"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-Shot-2011-08-09-at-12.41.57-2.png"" alt="""" width=""413"" height=""189"" />The conference was billed as an international conference, supported by <a href=""http://www.iacsit.org/"">an international organization</a>, and all publications and communications were in English. However, almost all participants were mainland Chinese, with the exceptions of a few visitors from Taiwan and Singapore, and the Thai professor. In my session, the papers were all delivered in English, but every single person in the audience spoke Mandarin fluently, and the question and answer sessions often turned into Chinese (which was much more productive, since the English levels of the participants were often not very good).However, there was one unexpected ""international"" aspect of the conference: the local students. Unbeknownst to me, Northwestern Normal University has a large group of international students in education, many of which were present. I met a number of students from Pakistan, India, Cambodia, Columbia and other countries doing their MAs and PhDs at the university, often with Chinese state scholarships. (For example, China offers 50 PhD scholarships to Pakistan each year, which makes up a substantial proportion of all PhD positions for Pakistani students). Some of these students spoke fluent Chinese, while others were studying in English.There was a large difference in the demeanour of these students to their Chinese counterparts. Many of them had been quite senior in their home countries before coming to China, and had much more ""life experience"", and they were not afraid to ask critical questions of the presenters. After my keynote, every single question that I received came from one of these international students, while the Chinese students and professors sat silent (of course, difference in English levels could also have played a role).I have been aware of the case of international students in China for a long time - when I first came to China in 2001, I had several friends among the large group of African international students at Wuhan University, and already on my way towards China, I met a large group of Nepali medical students at the university in Cheboksari in Russia. However, through all my visits to top schools of education in China, I have not met any international students, so this was an interesting experience. It also points towards an alternative route for ""internationalization"", and it would be interesting to look at what effect a significant group of international students can have on the Chinese students, and on the atmosphere in the class.<strong>Conclusion</strong>As I mentioned above, the academic level of the conference was quite low, but I still very much enjoyed it. The organization was great, and I met a number of interesting Chinese and international researchers whom I am sure I will stay in touch with. I know this blog post might seem critical, but I am very appreciate of the strong efforts Chinese universities and individual academics are putting in to bolster the level of research and exchange, and I think even such a ""not quite international"" conference can be a great starting point for graduate students who have never attended a large conference before. I look forward to seeing ICETC growing and improving, and I am very happy that I had the opportunity to interact with the students and staff at Northwestern Normal University!Stian","Open Courses and Informal Learning in a Web 2.0 World: A Research Agenda | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] recently gave a keynote presentation at ICETC 2011 in Changchun, where I discussed some of the experiences from facilitating the course &#8220;Introduction to [...].

We can use ""site-specific information-centric communities"" such as StackOverflow to get quick answers to something, while we are working on a problem (I absolutely agree with <a href=""http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/1882"">David Wiley</a> that this qualifies as learning).Much of my learning happens in what I call ""long-term distributed topic-based communities"". This would be something like the ""edublogosphere"", with people who discuss issues and share information over a long time, held together through RSS feeds, crosslinking, Twitter-hashtags, etc. However, as Mike Caulfield <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:PInY24gtNdsJ:mikecaulfield.com/2009/01/09/rise-of-the-cohort-educational-and-otherwise/+http://mikecaulfield.com/2009/01/09/rise-of-the-cohort-educational-and-otherwise/&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;source=www.google.com"">pointed out</a>, there is something very powerful about a cohort moving through a set learning path or collection of materials together. Open courses, whether they be small learning groups on <a href=""http://p2pu.org"">P2PU</a>, or big <a href=""http://mooc.ca"">MOOCs</a>, is about offering more people the opportunity to participate in such learning experiences.I then discussed some of the issues that came up during our course, such as the ""[[analysis_of_cscl-intro#amplification|dream of amplification]]"", [[analysis_of_cscl-intro#challenge|the various dimensions of open courses]], [[analysis_of_cscl-intro#how_this_played_out_in_our_course|the dimensions of course organizer ""authority""]] and [[analysis_of_cscl-intro#threaded_chat|our interesting experience with ""threaded chat""]].Finally, I discussed ways in which the course data [[analysis_of_cscl-intro#analysis|could be analyzed]] and introduced [[grappling_with_ideas-the_paper#stimulus_response|two metaphors for organizing online courses]]: stimulus/response and divergence/convergence, and looked at how the latter model could be implemented in an open course based on a multitude of Web 2.0 platforms.This talk, together with the links above, represent a lot of my current thinking and some of the research I would like to pursue.

They train local teachers, develop materials, provide some funding, and also invite volunteers from China and abroad for shorter stays. I had the chance to visit two of their schools a few years ago, and wrote <a href=""http://eprints.rclis.org/bitstream/10760/11695/1/Report_RCEF_libraries_2008.pdf"">a short report</a> on their school library projects. My wife also volunteered with them some years ago, and made <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV93Hx-CLlU"">a short movie</a> about their summer volunteer project.This past year, my wife has been spending a lot of time in the area near Guan&#039;ai (one of the two schools mentioned in my report) doing her own independent projects. Sun Huimiao, the old headmaster at Guan&#039;ai, is now working in a school at a nearby town, and she has brought all of the creativity, imagination and passion which she displayed at Guan&#039;ai.My wife worked with RCEF to document one of the projects Sun carried out with the primary school students. It&#039;s a real inquiry projects, initiated by students&#039; authentic curiosity, and pursued through discussion, watching videos, looking up online, creating posters, writing, and presenting. An incredibly refreshing sight after all the rows of Chinese students repeating as a choir (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BwIP89aMjA&amp;feature=related"">example</a>, although this classroom is much nicer than the ones in rural China, the repetition out load is very much the same).What is even more interesting about teacher Sun&#039;s case is that she is not a classroom teacher. Many of the students in the school stay in the dormitory (their parents might be from villages around, or they might have migrated to the big cities to look for work), and Sun works as a dormitory coordinator. Thus, this entire project was not in the context of a classroom, and was done entirely voluntarily by the students (of course, this also means teacher Sun was not constrained by any curriculum standards).Have a look at the great video below, of how Sun turns the students fascination with snails into a great inquiry project.(<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/RuralChina?blend=1&amp;ob=0#p/u/0/xE0RGw_pNbQ"">Slightly longer version</a>with more teacher reflection).http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjeZ6DMtlkk&amp;feature=youtu.beHope to see more of this kind of innovative teaching in Chinese rural schools (and indeed, I know RCEF are documenting other practices, including a wonderful reading circle that a teacher organizes with her students each week).StianPS: When looking for an example of students repeating out loud, I came across this <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHXBgc7JRZg"">BBC documentary series</a> on Chinese schools which looks well made and worth a look.PPS: The picture above is from my visit to Guan&#039;ai a few years back, and not from the school depicted in the movie.","Bodong Chen => Wonderful!!

Initially, I was thinking about Urdu - it&#039;s very similar to Hindi, which I can kind of understand orally (and read, although very slowly - I made it through one Hindi novel when I was in Varanasi (which looked somewhat like the picture to the left). I&#039;m really fascinated by the Arabic script, and given that I already kind of know the language, it makes more sense to try to learn to read Urdu than say Arabic...However, Arabic is tricky in it&#039;s own right (letters look different depending on whether it&#039;s at a start of a word, the end of a word, etc, and vowels are typically not included), and the typically writing style used with Urdu, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nastaliq"">Nastaliq</a>is very ornamented, and relies on stacking letters on top of each other in a way that I find very hard to decode. The picture below is not from a religious text, but the headline of a daily newspaper (which posts its articles as pictures, because they cannot replicate this effect using computer fonts).<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-25-at-13.50.18-.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1173"" title=""Screen Shot 2011-11-25 at 13.50.18"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-25-at-13.50.18-.png"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""99"" /></a>In contrast, below is a newspaper headline from a daily newspaper in Saudi Arabia, which uses the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naskh_(script)"">Naskh</a> style of writing, common for published secular material in the Arab-speaking world.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-25-at-13.55.05-.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1176"" title=""Screen Shot 2011-11-25 at 13.55.05"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-25-at-13.55.05-.png"" alt="""" width=""399"" height=""109"" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that&#039;s a challenge, but obviously not something completely insuperable. However, the other thing that kept bugging me is that even if I put in a lot of effort to learn to read Urdu, there isn&#039;t really that much <em>worth</em>reading that&#039;s easily available to me...Don&#039;t get me wrong, there&#039;s a great <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu_poetry"">Urdu poetry tradition</a>, and I&#039;ve always wanted to read the works of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn-e-Safi"">Ibn-e Safi</a>, a Pakistani who never travelled outside Pakistan, but wrote a 120-book ouvre about a Pakistani spy on secret missions around the world... But it&#039;s very hard to find Urdu literature online, or in Toronto (if I find it online, it&#039;s typically in scanned format, which means I cannot use online dictionaries), and just like with the Indian languages, there isn&#039;t that much modern literature being written (English being more prominent).<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-25-at-14.51.35-.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1181"" style=""border-image: initial; margin: 5px;"" title=""Screen Shot 2011-11-25 at 14.51.35"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-25-at-14.51.35-.png"" alt="""" width=""225"" height=""345"" /></a>I still really want to learn Urdu, as well as proper fluent Hindi for that matter, at some point. But in the meantime, I decided to study... <strong>Russian</strong>! I know, quite different. But it&#039;s another language which I&#039;ve learnt a bit of, but never gained fluency in.My first meeting with Russian was taking the trans-Siberian from Norway to Beijing for my first trip to China (and first time leaving Europe) in 2001. I spent a month there, visiting Esperantists. Later, I travelled through Russia on the train one more time, and also spent some time travelling through the &#039;stans in Central Asia. I picked up a few words, but never learnt much.Then in 2004, I had a chance to go to People&#039;s Friendship University of Russia for a one month intensive course in Russian, together with activists from different civil society organizations in Europe, funded by the European Council (the picture below is from the school&#039;s homepage).<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-25-at-14.58.33-.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1182"" title=""Screen Shot 2011-11-25 at 14.58.33"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-25-at-14.58.33-.png"" alt="""" width=""405"" height=""174"" /></a>The school is a pretty interesting place - it&#039;s where a lot of African and Asian leaders were trained in the communist era, and to this day 60% of the students are from Asia and Africa. We had this wonderful old babushka of a teacher, who had dedicated her life to teaching Russian to foreigners, and we learnt a lot. But of course, there&#039;s still a limit to how much you can learn during a month - and worse, I barely ever had a chance to use Russian in the years after (this was in 2003).So I can read the alphabet, know some of the grammar, and remember some of the words, but that&#039;s about it. Now, the neat thing about Russian, which I&#039;ve been noticing during the last few years, is that there is a huge amount of material available online. Russian literature is well known, but there is not just classical literature, there are tons of novels being published continuously. And most of this is readily available online. As well as Russian movies, and the thing that I love - audiobooks!So somehow I made a snap decision, and decided to do a <strong>30-day Russian Challenge</strong>. Rather than reading a classical novel, I wanted to read something that is very popular in Russia right now. I came across <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Akunin"">Boris Akunin</a>, who seems really cool, and is apparently one of the best-selling authors currently. He writes detective novels set in Tsarist Russia, and is very web savvy - his novels are available for free download on his website, and he has even created websites for some of the characters in his books.So I grabbed one of his books, <a href=""http://www.boris-akunin.com/bk_winterqueen.html"">The Winter Queen</a>, or <a href=""http://www.akunin.ru/knigi/fandorin/erast/azazel/"">Азазель</a> in Russian, and was able to download the full-text in both English and Russian. I also found the audio book in Russian! So for one month, I will spend one hour each day (technically two <a href=""http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/"">pomodori</a>) reading the novel in Russian, using the <a href=""http://mac.gettranslateit.com/"">TranslateIt</a>dictionary to provide mouse-over dictionary look-up. The way I do it, is to have the book open in TextEdit, so I can use the mouse-over dictionary. For every few sentences or paragraph, I read the same section of the book in the English translation, on my Kindle. I find this kind of bi-lingual reading really effective (it would be great if more authors put out bi-lingual editions, but in the meantime, we can hack it like this).I have no idea if this is the best way to learn a language - choosing a fairly complex book, rather than a pedagogically adapted text, but at this point, I&#039;m much more interested in reading an interesting, authentic text, rather than something that was designed for me.<em>Update: I wrote the draft for this blog post in November, and did enjoy this ""Russian challenge"" for about two weeks, making steady progress and having a lot of fun, before I fell out of it due to too many other commitments. I am going to try to take up the thread again now, so I am finally posting this.</em>Stian&nbsp;",Two articles about Chinese open courses published,"academia/research,china,MA thesis,The Top Level Courses Project,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2012/02/08/two-articles-about-chinese-open-courses-published/,"I <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/09/13/ma-thesis-on-open-educational-resources-in-china-released-watch-it-fly/"">released</a> my <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">MA thesis</a> about Chinese Open Courses September 13, 2010, and more than a year later, two journal articles partly based on the thesis have also appeared, one in English and one in Chinese.<strong>British Journal of Educational Technology</strong><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1225"" style=""margin: 5px;"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-02-08 at 07.59.34"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-Shot-2012-02-08-at-07.59.34.png"" alt="""" width=""114"" height=""165"" /><a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/practical-model.pdf"">The English article</a> appeared in <a href=""http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0007-1013"">British Journal of Educational Technology</a>as <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-8535/earlyview"">""Online First""</a>in November 2011. Judging by the backlog, it might not make it into the actual journal for another year, however since it&#039;s available online, I count it as ""published"".This article was a very long time in the making, a process which began a year before my MA thesis was completed. It is based on a paper which <a href=""http://www.core.org.cn/cn/teacher/teacher_35500.html"">Wang Long</a>wrote for <a href=""http://www.irrodl.org/"">International Review of Research on Open and Distance Learning</a>(IRRODL). Wang Long works at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_People&#039;s_Public_Security_University"">Chinese People&#039;s Public Security University</a>, and I had seen his name on a number of articles about Chinese Top Level Courses, so when I was in Beijing, I contacted him. It was quite funny, as I was standing outside the ports of the university waiting for him. He called me on his cellphone asking me where I was, and I said ""right here"". It turns out that he didn&#039;t expect me to be a foreigner, and I didn&#039;t expect him to be dressed in a police uniform.<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1227"" style=""margin: 5px;"" title=""20-100H3140K80-L-lp"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/20-100H3140K80-L-lp.jpg"" alt="""" width=""233"" height=""180"" />I was very impressed by Wang Long as a person with a real passion for OER, who has pursued his research for many years, often without funding or external support. He told me that IRRODL had told him his paper was very interesting, but the English was not good enough, and asked if I would be willing to work with him to improve it.It turned out that it wasn&#039;t only the English which needed editing, the article itself was written in a way that would have been very foreign to non-Chinese readers. Thus began a two-year process of collaborating on improving the article. The article flew between Toronto and Beijing, with long emails about changes and discussions of sources. We decided to target the British Journal of Educational Technology (which even has a <a href=""http://www.wiley.com/bw/editors.asp?ref=0007-1013&amp;site=1"">corresponding editor in China</a>), and submitted the first draft in December 2010.We got positive feedback, but lot&#039;s of comments, and spent about three months addressing these. At that point, my MA thesis had already been published, and I was able to incorporate interview data and references from that as well. The second draft was submitted, more comments, and finally the third draft was fully accepted. <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2011.01254.x/full"">Official version</a>, <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/practical-model.pdf"">PDF</a>.<strong>Open Education Research Journal (Chinese)</strong><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-Shot-2012-02-08-at-12.37.15.png"" alt="""" width=""218"" height=""299"" />After <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/06/01/chinese-translation-of-ma-thesis-on-top-level-courses-available/"">having my thesis translated into Chinese</a>(<a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/Jingpinkecheng-Haklev-zh.pdf"">PDF</a>), I also wanted to turn it into a journal article in a Chinese journal. Again I worked with Wang Long, who too a first stab of shortening the thesis to a journal article. We collaborated closely on highlighting the aspects I thought would be the most interesting for a Chinese audience, and making it into a coherent whole (something that would have been almost impossible for me without his help).We finally had the article accepted by <a href=""http://openedu.shtvu.org.cn/frontsite/index.asp"">开放教育研究杂志</a> (Open Education Research Journal), hosted at Shanghai TV University, which has published a long series of articles about China Top Level Courses and foreign OER projects.The article came out in January, and is currently available online. <a href=""http://openedu.shtvu.org.cn/frontsite/series_details.asp?id=1405"">Official version</a>, <a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/kaifangjiaoyuyanjiu2012.pdf"">PDF</a>.I am still planning one more journal publication from the thesis (which I should have gotten out a long time ago), but I am quite happy with these two publications, and especially happy for the great collaboration with Wang Long. I think this way of helping each other getting published in ""each others"" languages is a great model that could be useful to others as well.Stian","Results of a 1.5 year academic publishing experiment | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] just wrote about two articles published based on my MA thesisabout Chinese Open Courses, and this inspired me to [...].

I began this process by having my undergraduate thesis <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/09/20/mencerdaskan-bangsa-an-inquiry-into-the-phenomenon-of-taman-bacaan-in-indonesia/"">translated into Indonesian</a>, but with my MA thesis, I wanted to go further.<strong>Publishing formats</strong><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-Shot-2012-02-08-at-14.02.131.png"" alt="""" width=""214"" height=""266"" />My thesis is licensed under the<a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"">Creative Commons BY license</a>, which allows others to modify and build upon your work. However, it is very difficult to modify a work that is in a non-modifiable file format. Therefore, I wanted to release my thesis in a format that was modifiable - in this case, I chose Word DOC, RTF and<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument"">Open Document Format</a>(ODT) to cover all cases (it&#039;s trivial to generate several formats from the same program).&nbsp;Some people like to print out long documents for ease of reading. The standard way of formatting an MA thesis, with double line space and generous margins, is great for editing and annotation, but not ideal for general reading. So I created another version, with two columns, wider margins, and single line spacing (this was also available in all the formats listed above).<img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-Shot-2012-02-08-at-14.02.26.png"" alt="""" width=""180"" height=""270"" />E-book readers are also becoming more and more popular, and are especially well-suited to long form reading like theses.

I also tried to make the book available on Kindle as a self-published book, but Amazon will not allow free self-published books, and I didn&#039;t want to charge for one version, while others were free. (I did publish to SmashWords, but they messed up the Chinese characters).<img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-Shot-2012-02-08-at-15.36.381.png"" alt="""" width=""249"" height=""339"" />Once I had the Chinese translation ready in July, 2011, I also posted several versions of this, including PDF, Word, RTF and ODT<strong>Other dissemination methods</strong>In addition to posting the files, I decided to experiment with syndicating the thesis on my blog. This had two purposes. First, I personally often end up downloading a lot of long documents, without ever getting around to reading them. However, if you ""drip feed"" me information over many days, I am much more likely to absorb the information.The other point was to give each individual ""piece"" of the thesis an individual URL, so that people could link t<img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-Shot-2012-02-08-at-15.55.51.png"" alt="""" width=""308"" height=""241"" />o it. In addition to making a main point, every thesis probably consists of a number of logical ""pieces"", which have some value in themselves. There is the overview of Chinese higher education history in the lit review, there is the section on a commercial ecosystem around open courses in China, etc. Now, other blogs or websites which want to refer to these pieces can link directly to them rather than saying ""look up page 50 in this PDF"". (Having individual URLs also makes it much easier to tweet and retweet links).<br class=""Apple-interchange-newline"" /><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-Shot-2012-02-08-at-14.02.52.png"" alt="""" width=""200"" height=""269"" />So I posted the thesis on my blog progressively over a period of months, always tweeting out links as well. Some of the blog posts got a number of retweets and were also mentioned in other blogs on OER.I also uploaded <a href=""https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/25651"">my thesis</a> to<a href=""https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/"">T-Space</a>, the University of Toronto repository, as we are obliged to do according to the policy of the university, and also uploaded it to <a href=""http://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Chinese_National_Top_Level_Courses_P.html?id=a6YLw1p45K8C&amp;redir_esc=y"">Google Books</a>.<strong>Statistics</strong><strong></strong>So after almost 1.5 years, what do the numbers look like? I use both AWStats and Google Analytics to analyze my traffic - neither is perfect. AWStats often overreport hits, because of all the referral spam, however Google Analytics does not capture PDF downloads at all. I also think the download numbers are far less exaggerated than the page hits. So I looked up the download statistics for the last 1.5 years to see which files were most downloaded.In total, my thesis has been downloaded 2.600 times.<table><tbody><tr><th>Language</th><th>Downloads</th></tr><tr><td>English</td><td>2132</td></tr><tr><td>Chinese</td><td>458</td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp;<br><table><tbody><tr><th>Format</th><th>Downloads</th></tr><tr><td>PDF</td><td>1291</td></tr><tr><td>DOC</td><td>622</td></tr><tr><td>RTF</td><td>398</td></tr><tr><td>ODT</td><td>121</td></tr><tr><td>ebook</td><td>158</td></tr></tbody></table><img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-Shot-2012-02-08-at-16.20.27.png"" alt="""" width=""307"" height=""236"" />In addition, the thesis got downloaded 29 times from T-Space. This seems incredibly little, but in this particular case, it is not very surprising. First, it was only published several months later on T-Space, because the university waits until convocation before releasing the documents. At this point, many of the downloads from my website had already happened. Also, because I released so much information from my own website, anyone searching for my thesis would find links to my website, instead of T-Space. I think T-Space is a good option for students who do not have an active web presence, but its clear from these statistics that T-Space does not promote browsing and exploration (not strange, given its quite convoluted design).I also got very low numbers at Google Books, again probably because my other files came up much higher in searches. (In contrast, I got quite high reading numbers for my undergraduate honors thesis on Google Books, particularly the Indonesian version).<strong>Non-numeric outcomes and the future</strong>These numbers by themselves don&#039;t necessarily mean all that much, they don&#039;t tell me how many people have read the thesis, or how many people found it useful. But it&#039;s quite interesting to see, for example the distribution of file formats (despite the fact that it&#039;s so easy to generate multiple formats that even if few people download them, a case could still be made for making them available). In addition to pure numbers, I have connected with many interesting people, and met people at conferences that I didn&#039;t even know who told me ""I followed your thesis with interest"". I even had an e-mail from a journal editor inviting me to turn my thesis into a paper for his journal.<img class=""alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-Shot-2012-02-08-at-16.34.13.png"" alt="""" width=""258"" height=""186"" />I hope this post has inspired you to think about how you publish your own research, whether it&#039;s your MA or PhD thesis, or you are further in your academic career.

I want to see what empirical research has already been done (not a whole lot), and also what theoretical frameworks and methods others have used to investigate/discuss this topic. In fact, just the framing itself of what is an open course, and why they are so interesting to me, is quite fascinating.I already had some interesting papers, but I spent quite a lot of time finding others, both by Google Scholar searches for keywords, and by finding out who are ""active in the field"", and looking at lists of all of their publications. Generally, there is an incredible amount of writings on Open Educational Resources, but much less on learning interactions. Many of the papers which showed up in the keyword searches were very generalist, and tended to mention for example Peer2Peer University in a sentence as ""one interesting new possibility"".I&#039;m hoping to write up a much more organized literature review during this week, so I will not spend this blog entry trying to accomplish that, but I will quickly list the articles I&#039;ve read that I&#039;ve also taken detailed notes on (there are many more which I read and took clippings of, but have not yet written detailed notes about). Some of the papers below I had read before, without taking notes, so I had to go through them again to see what I could use in the literature review:<ul><li>I read a number of papers by <a href=""http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/"">Martin Weller</a>, and I found his metaphor of the ""topography of formality"" quite visual and striking in [@weller2007bridging]</li><li>A bunch of papers about [[MOOC]]s and learning, including [@mcauley2010mooc], [@mackness2010ideals], [@kop2011pedagogy], [@kop2011cloud], [@fini2009technological] and [@bell2010network]</li><li>Rita Kop also wrote about personal learning networks in [@kop2010design]</li><li>It was interesting to hear about Alec Couros&#039; course EC&amp;I 831 in [@couros2010developing]</li><li>I came across Paul Bouchard in Rita Kop&#039;s writings and found some of his early work on adult learners very interesting, I read [@bouchard1998teaching], [@bouchard1998distance], [@bouchard1994self-directed] and [@bouchard1996study]</li><li>Read some papers on the history and development of Open University UK, including [@mcandrew2010defining]</li></ul>I read 34 more papers where I did not add significant notes yet. Some of these were not interesting, or mostly rehashes of other papers, but for most I will have to go back and add significant notes. I find it takes much more mental capacity to add high-level notes than to do the first read-through, but it&#039;s incredibly valuable. Maybe I will try to track the relationship between articles read and high-level notes written during the coming weeks (I modified the cleanup script to make this easy to display).<strong></strong><strong>Researchr</strong><strong></strong>I tried to focus on literature review, and not do any work on <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start"">Researchr</a>.

And sometimes I get ideas that I just ""have to try out"".Researchr is built on <a href=""http://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki"">DokuWiki</a>, which has worked out incredibly well. It stores all the data in flat text files (for example the page [[andragogy]] is stored in /wiki/data/pages/andragogy.txt, and the contents is identical to the wikimarkup you see when you edit a page). This means that I can easily access and modify these text files from scripts, I can search and index them using external tools, backing up is as easy as copying the entire DokuWiki folder to another location, and I can easily keep two versions in sync through rsync. (This is how I edit locally, and publish to my server).Within DokuWiki, I use a large number of [[researchr:dokuwiki_plugins|plugins]] to get the functionality I need. One of the most crucial one is the <a href=""http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:include"">include plugin</a>. This lets you include another wiki page into the current wiki page. If you look at an article page, like [@bouchard2001experiential], you see that it contains several sections - it starts out with a citation, and some links (including a hidden BibTeX field), then there are the high level notes, then the raw clippings from Skim, and finally the pictures I&#039;ve imported from Skim.However, if you click on edit this page, after the top citation information, all you see is this:<pre>{{page&gt;notes:bouchard2001experiential}}</pre><pre>h2. Links here{{backlinks&gt;.}}</pre><pre>{{page&gt;clip:bouchard2001experiential}}</pre><pre>{{page&gt;kindle:bouchard2001experiential}}</pre><pre>{{page&gt;skimg:bouchard2001experiential}}</pre>This is because the information is stored in a number of other files, with the same file name, but in other namespaces. (A namespace in a wiki is kind of like a directory). The fact that the clippings and the high level notes are stored separately is what enables ""side-by-side"" editing:<a href=""http://localhost/wiki/researchr:screenshots""><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/_media/pages:researchr_screenshots04.png"" alt="""" width=""450"" height=""284"" /></a>It&#039;s also what makes it possible to go back and add more highlights to the Skim file, and export that again to the wiki, without overwriting high level notes, etc.However, the one challenge with this approach is that DokuWiki doesn&#039;t understand that I never really want to see the pages in the clip: namespace alone, I always want to see them in the context of a full publication (with the head page in the ref: namespace). So when I added automatic<a href=""http://dokuwiki.org/plugin:backlinks2"">backlinks</a>to articles (which you see included above, using another plugin), they would display as ""Key ideas"" (because that&#039;s usually the title I use for the notes: section), and when I did a search, it would look like below:<img class="" wp-image-1307 alignnone"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-04-11 at 19.03.45"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-11-at-19.03.45.png"" alt="""" width=""466"" height=""317"" />I thought it would be fun to try to rewrite the search to take into account what I know about the structure of the data. I am very poor at php, and not familiar with the DokuWiki code base (I&#039;ve written some very simple plugins before to support Researchr, but never really touched the main code base).It took me quite a while, both figuring out the flow of the program, and coming up with something which worked. I fixed the backlinks quite quickly, and then had some fun re-imagining the search.In addition to the namespaces that make out an article page, I also have a few ""semantic"" namespaces, such as a: for <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/a:start"">authors</a>, and t: for <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/t:start"">tools</a>. I&#039;ve also created namespaces for conferences I&#039;ve attended, like cscl11: for<a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/cscl11:start"">CSCL 2011</a>(although I&#039;ve been thinking for a while that I should consolidate them under a conf: namespace). I thought that it might be fun to let search be ""aware"" of these distinctions.Initially I thought I had come up with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search"">""faceted search""</a>, but looking at the Wikipedia entry, I think I would have needed to give several different ways of sorting the hits, rather than just one.I removed the snippets, since they look ugly (wiki markup isn&#039;t rendered) and it seemed to slow things down quite a bit. Either way, opening a link highlights all the hits, and moves automatically to the first hit.I experimented with replacing hits on article pages (and clips, notes etc) with the full citations, but found that far too ugly (<a href=""http://reganmian.net/files/researchr_find_with_citations.png"">see screenshot</a>), so I ended up with just using the page names (which are the article titles). I might experiment with this in the future.Either way, I&#039;m quite pleased with the result, even though the code is a horror (I&#039;m did the experimentation on my live wiki, so I need to clean it up and move it to the DokuWiki fork in the<a href=""http://github.com/houshuang/folders2web"">Researchr GitHub repository</a>, but I threw up a quick<a href=""https://gist.github.com/2362754"">gist</a>).<img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-1315"" title=""researchr-find-new"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/researchr-find-new1-469x1024.png"" alt="""" width=""469"" height=""1024"" />Of course, the search is live now, so you can <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/?do=search&amp;id=constructivis*&amp;button="">try for yourself</a>.Stian","Using web clipping and sidewiki to gather and synthesize information | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] and I use it to turn the raw clippings from PDFs I&#8217;ve read in Skim into higher level notes (as detailed here), but the functionality is available on any webpage.

In total, I now have high-level notes on [[a:Paul Bouchard|13 of his papers on his author page]].I revisited Joe Corneli and Charlie Danoff&#039;s work on ""[[paragogy]]"", and I&#039;ve read [[paragogy|eight of their papers]].

However, the daily schedule here is quite exhausting, and there were also sessions that were not that relevant to my research, lack of battery etc, which meant that I did not take notes of that many sessions. So far I have [[Aera12:start|notes from four sessions]] (usually with five presentations each), including two about [[self-regulated learning]], one about [[wikis in education]], and one about computer-supported collaborative learning.I also had a chance to meet with <a href=""http://learnstream.org/wiki/"">Ryan Muller</a>, another user of Researchr, and we had a great four-hour walk through Stanley park and Granville Island discussing possible future ideas for Researchr, Open Access publishing, etc. I also met with <a href=""http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.ca/"">Heather Morrison</a>and <a href=""http://www.researchremix.org/wordpress/"">Heather Piwowar</a>, both very active in Open Access from different perspectives, and had very exciting conversations with them - expect to see more about that in the future.<strong></strong><strong>Researchr</strong>As usual, I couldn&#039;t quite avoid stealing in some time to work on <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start"">Researchr</a>, and I made <a href=""https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web/compare/a2da690794054936b467853154bd4fa49dd538a7...a4e076fb6d4cda03cfaf24095e6f703523234787"">15 commits</a>.In addition to the weekly review, I felt the need for a space to keep unstructured notes and ideas for future processing. I thought it would be really nice if I could capture the context in which these notes had been made, and I used a modification of the cleanup script I introduced last week to automatically output a list of the articles and pages I had been working on during the last 24 hours, as a proxy for my ""mental context"" at the time of taking the notes.

The first is to say that the current system is wonderful, but many people are locked out &ndash; academics at smaller institutions, teachers and school administrations, the public, etc. Our goal in this case would be to give everyone in the world access to download PDFs from Elsevier and Springer, and the research would largely be policy-related.Another perspective would be to ask: What new ways of interacting with publications can be enabled by Open Access, which are impossible with Toll Access journals, even those for which you have paid subscription fees. I believe this is in some ways a more compelling story for many authors, because the first argument is largely based on charity &ndash; they might think that they themselves, and all their friends at elite universities, all have access. However, the second approach is to show how Open Access can make your research work easier and faster, even when you are at an elite institution.Of course, the extent to which innovative new workflows and analyses can be implemented also depend on the ""degree"" of openess, given that the term Open Access covers a wide array of cases. The minimal (but also the most common) case is to expect the ability to download a PDF without logging in, or paying money. The ideal case would be a Creative Commons-licensed article, preferably in a semantic open text-based format (not PDF), with machine-readable metadata, linked datasets, <a href=""http://opencitations.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/introducing-the-semantic-publishing-and-referencing-spar-ontologies/"">semantic citations</a>, etc.I have spent a lot of time pushing for policy change around OA, and I am in awe of what we have already accomplished, and I also know we have a lot left to do. However, I feel that the OA community has not sufficiently addressed this other technical part, and I believe increasing the use-value of OA journals can do a lot to convince academics to become more active with self-archiving etc.<strong>Researchr</strong>I mentioned a number of dimensions of openness above, but even with just the PDF file available, there are things we can do. When I see a citation in a journal article, on a social citation sharing website, or on somebody&#039;s blog or wiki, which I find interesting, what is the first thing I want to do? Import the citation <strong>and</strong>the PDF into my citation manager.If you are really lucky, the location that posted the citation also offers machine-readable metadata, such as BibTeX. However, there is very seldom any distinction made between OA and non-OA publications &ndash; in both cases, the PDFs are not hosted on the site, because of copyright issues (which is correct in most cases, since a very small percentage of OA articles are openly licensed). Sadly, it is very rare that the metadata contains a link to download the PDF, even though theoretically, that would actually be the <em>most important</em>part of the metadata. (After all, the reason we create such standardized formatting schemes is to make it easy for other people to locate the article we cited).And the few times the URL field in a BibTeX entry is filled in, it goes to an abstract page, from which we can download the PDF. The same is true for DOI, which always resolves to an HTML abstract page, and almost never to the actual publication &ndash; even when the publication is OA, and can be downloaded without login, etc.Initially, Researchr was no distinction. I simply captured the BibTeX offered by Google Scholar, or other sites. Of course, I alwaysendeavored to find the PDF and download for my own purposes, but I was not able to share these online, because of copyright. Thus, an article page on my wiki for an OA article, would look identical to that of a TA article, and users would have to copy the title into Google Scholar to locate the PDF.<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1333"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-04-17 at 09.53.35"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-17-at-09.53.35.png"" alt="""" width=""262"" height=""182"" />I really wanted to change this, and thought about ways of automatically capturing the download URL when importing PDFs. It turns out there is a very elegant solution &ndash; OSX Finder stores the download URL as part of a file&#039;s metadata, even when using Chrome.We can easily access this information through the command line<pre>mdls -name kMDItemWhereFroms FILENAME</pre>Thus I could easily add this URL to the citation&#039;s metadata, tag it as Open Access, display this in various ways in the wiki, etc.However, was the file really Open Access? If I am sitting at the University of Toronto, I can download PDFs from all the big publishers, because they have ""whitelisted"" the IP ranges belonging to the University of Toronto. However, these PDFs are not available outside of the university. How to distinguish?I wrote <a href=""https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web/blob/master/check-oa.rb"">a tiny little API</a>, which I uploaded to my public server, which sits outside of University of Toronto, and does not have any special privileges. It accepts a URL as an argument, and attempts to download the header of that URL (ie. even though the PDF might be 5MB, it will only download a few hundred bytes). It checks whether the URL accepts at all, and whether it is of the kind ""PDF"" (ie. it&#039;s not an HTML abstract page).<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""https://gist.github.com/2407649.js""></script>If successful, it simply returns ""true"", and the URL is added to the file&#039;s metadata.<img class=""alignnone  wp-image-1341"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-04-17 at 10.18.22"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-17-at-10.18.22.png"" alt="""" width=""412"" height=""48"" />So far, I have not done anything specific to display this fact, although the citation template automatically displays the contents of the URL field in the citation.<img class=""alignnone  wp-image-1342"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-04-17 at 10.36.02"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-17-at-10.36.02.png"" alt="""" width=""388"" height=""74"" />Eventually, I want to make a big nice (green?) icon next to this metadata field saying ""PDF Download"" or something similar. However, since the URL field is also present in the hidden machine-readable metadata field below, we are able to do some fun stuff.<img class=""alignnone  wp-image-1345"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-04-17 at 10.40.12"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-17-at-10.40.12.png"" alt="""" width=""392"" height=""74"" />I traditionally used Ctrl+Alt+Cmd+B as a shortcut to grab a citation from Google Scholar. I <a href=""https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web/blob/master/bibdesk.rb#L100-124"">enhanced</a> this script to also look for the hidden BibTeX on a Researchr wiki page. If it finds it, it imports it into BibDesk. If it also finds a URL field, it attempts to automatically download the PDF, and autolink it to the citation in BibDesk.I further had some fun with the page numbers from the raw clippings &ndash; if you press a page number on somebody else&#039;s wiki, and the metadata has the URL field, it will attempt to download the PDF, and open it on the correct page!

Currently, this functionality only exists in Researchr, but all the data is open and standardized (BibTeX), so other citation managers could build this in as well &ndash; and ideally, more metadata will come with the URL field filled in. In fact, maybe we need a new field, something like OA-URL, to denote both that the publication is OA, and that this is a URL that goes directly to a download, rather than to an HTML abstract. (In fact, embedding the publication license in the BibTeX metadata wouldn&#039;t be dumb either).Stian","Making Open Access articles much more visible, automatically | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] April, I wrote about my desire to make OA publications much more visible on my academic wiki, and whenever I cite them.

Support is available for this process; faculty members are encouraged to provide an electronic copy of the final version of the article at no charge to the appropriate representative of the OISE/UT Library, who will make the article available to the public in T-Space, the open access repository operated by the University of Toronto Libraries.</em></blockquote>This policy is the result of more than three years of work led by a group of people in the ""Research Standing Committee Open Access sub-committee"", which included discussions in the Research Standing Committee and Faculty Council, as well as an <a href=""http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/oise/UserFiles/File/TownHallFlyer.pdf"">open Town Hall meeting</a>(see <a href=""http://142.150.98.64/OISE/20101119-121753-1/rnh.htm"">recording of the entire meeting</a>, or just <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVBWvBAyZFE"">my 5 minute appeal</a>). Originally it began life as a ""mandate"", modeled on, and inspired by the mandates at <a href=""http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies"">Harvard</a>, <a href=""http://libraries.mit.edu/sites/scholarly/mit-open-access/open-access-at-mit/mit-open-access-policy/"">MIT</a> and <a href=""http://ed.stanford.edu/faculty-research/open-archive/oapolicy"">Stanford School of Education</a>. This work got a boost by <a href=""https://vimeo.com/40979206"">a very spirited presentation by John Willinsky</a> during Open Access Week 2009.In the end, however, this turned out to be very difficult, with the mandate being challenged by university lawyers, the faculty union, questions about whether the Faculty Council had the authority to approve it, etc. Finally, we decided to go for a much-watered down ""policy"" to at least get some movement.Because of the way academia works in North America, any mandate would anyway be quite toothless given the required opt-out clauses. Thus, no matter what the actual policy says, much of the work is in creating a <em>culture of Open Access</em>, providing technical support for submitting, coming up with guidelines and workflows, and changing mindsets.There have been a wide range of events during the past few years to popularize Open Access at University of Toronto and at OISE, including <a href=""http://www.openaccessweek.org/"">Open Access Week</a>in <a href=""http://discover.library.utoronto.ca/open-access-week/open-access-events-2009"">2009</a>,<a href=""http://discover.library.utoronto.ca/open-access-week/open-access-events"">2010</a> and <a href=""http://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/oaweek"">2011</a>.[caption id=""attachment_1355"" align=""alignnone"" width=""360"" caption=""Open Access week display in OISE lobby""]<img class="" wp-image-1355  "" title=""4098198609_a9d5872645"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/4098198609_a9d5872645.jpg"" alt="""" width=""360"" height=""270"" />[/caption]There has also been much practical work done with making T-Space easier to use (although we have a long way to go there), exposing statistics, etc. The library, with support from the Open Access sub-committee has created <a href=""http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/ec/UserFiles/File/OISEFacultyUsersGuideDRAFT(2).pdf"">guidelines for OISE faculty to deposit in T-Space</a>, and hired work-for-study students to help faculty deposit their publications.So much has been done, but much more remains to be done. It&#039;s interesting to contrast the relative inertia of the field of education, with other fields such as the hard sciences, computer science or medicine. Despite a great interest in <a href=""http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/rspe/"">knowledge mobilization</a>at OISE, not many see the connections between this and Open Access.It&#039;s especially funny for such a ""radical"" institution, where many professors are feminists and activists writing about popular education movements in Latin America, the Occupy Wall-Street movements, etc. Yet, how many of them have even heard about the growing movement of over 10,000 scientists who have <a href=""http://thecostofknowledge.com/"">vowed to boycott <del>Springer</del> Elsevier</a>? And what are we doing about Taylor and Francis, which in many cases give us fewer rights to self-archive than <del>Springer</del> Elsevier does? (T&amp;F are behind 70% of the journals that OISE faculty publish in).One policy down, lot&#039;s of work left to do! :)Stian","Open Access Week 2012 | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] Multilingual Open Educational Resources for a Multilingual and Multicultural UWC  from Stian Hklev Later that year gave an impassioned three minute speech about why OISE should adopt an open access mandate at a town-hall (the mandate was watered-down to a policy, which was eventually adopted).

The way it works is that I select some text (if I don&#039;t select any text, it will just use the page URL), and hit a key combo (Ctrl+Alt+Cmd+I). The system then pops up a box asking me which page I want to add the clipping to.<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1372"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-05-10 at 22.42.33"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-10-at-22.42.33.png"" alt="""" width=""389"" height=""286"" />Above you see such a box - it automatically grabs the title from the web page to be used for the link, but allows me to edit it. I click OK, get a tiny <a href=""http://growl.info"">Growl</a> acknowledgement, and I can continue on with no interruption.<img class=""size-full wp-image-1373 alignleft"" style=""margin: 5px;"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-05-10 at 22.44.45"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-10-at-22.44.45.png"" alt="""" width=""299"" height=""60"" />I might find some more text that I want to clip, from the same page, or from a different page, and I can simply click Ctrl+Alt+Cmd+J for ""clip-again"", which will send the text to the same place I sent the last clipping, without bothering to ask (again I will only see a Growl acknowledgment). This is on the theory that often you are gathering information on the same topic from several sources.If the page doesn&#039;t already exist, it gets created with the proper headline. If it already exists, the new text or URL gets appended at the bottom of the page, separated by a line, and with a link back to the original page. If the clipping was from an article in researchr, the link is a properly formatted citation.The idea is that I don&#039;t necessarily need to ""integrate"" the information with the rest of the article right away. I can keep adding information to it, and when I get around to it, I can sit down and organize it properly. Sometimes I go out to research a subject, and add a large amount of links or information in an afternoon, and then sit down to organize it, other times pages grow slowly from month to month, before I get around to doing anything.The article on [[fuzzy text matching]] is a good example of the result of a day&#039;s work, where I finally sat down to clean it up, and document some results of my experimentation. During the clipping, <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/fuzzy_text_matching?rev=1331575530"">it looked quite messy</a>.<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1382"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-05-10 at 22.57.03"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-10-at-22.57.031.png"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""385"" /></p>But the [[fuzzy text matching|the final version]] is a very useful reference for me, and might even be useful to others.<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1383"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-05-10 at 22.56.29"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-10-at-22.56.29.png"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""360"" />I recently came across an interesting <a href=""http://steve-wheeler.blogspot.ca/2011/07/learning-is-learning.html"">blog entry</a> criticizing the theory of andragogy, which I had seen referred to in several papers on MOOCs. Not only were the points in the blog post well made, but the post had attracted a range of comments, and some had even written entire blog posts in response. I felt the need to summarize and organize this information, so I used the clipping functionality to grab all the relevant text, and then used the side-by-side view to organize the article.The side-by-side view is inspired by the split-screen view in <a href=""http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php"">Scrivener</a> (of course, this is not something that Scrivener invented, but that is where I really learnt the power of having raw notes on one side, and the thing you are writing on the other side), and I use it to turn the raw clippings from PDFs I&#039;ve read in Skim into higher level notes (<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2012/04/11/semantic-researchrdokuwiki-search/"">as detailed here</a>), but the functionality is available on any webpage.

This gave me a much better overview of the different arguments, and gives me a good base to go out and learn more about andragogy, or to think more critically about whether the theory is relevant or not.I made a quick screencast showing the tools in use, pretty much as I&#039;ve narrated in this blog post.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr2GH1efSHUStian","Making Open Access articles much more visible, automatically | Random Stuff that Matters => [...] Once I have this data, how do I represent it?

My experiences with Knowledge Forum (mentioned in the link above) taught me the importance of being able to ""move ideas around"", rather then having them fixed wherever they happened to be first entered. I&#039;ve also been very inspired by experiences in physical workshop settings, writing down ideas on sticky notes and moving them around as new categories emerged, for example.<img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/_media/ideas:visual011.png"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""322"" />But in fact, this goes further back then that. I remember in my first year as an undergraduate, as we had to read papers, and write essays, and I gradually developed a technique of studying that fit my own style. I never liked using yellow markers on our reading packages, because I felt that these highlights would be ""trapped"" inside the different papers. Instead, I would read the papers and take copious notes on my laptop, in a very informal manner, with many abbreviations, for example:<pre>Johnson (1999)</pre><pre>p 5. diff. betw. CIDA and USAIDp 6. USAID &amp; support US farmersp 11. food aid -&gt; depressed foodprices in dev&#039;l countries (see Wilkensky), IMF</pre>In this way I quickly captured the important points of the article, and in a format which was ""fungible"". Later, when I sat down to write the paper for class, I would have several text edit windows, create headings, and copy lines over to different topics, for example:<pre><strong>Corruption:</strong></pre><pre>Johnson 1999 p 6. corruption decreases mostly linearly with GDP growthPeterson 2011 p 17. corruption is linked to social history, and not connected to economic growth</pre><pre><strong>Good governance:</strong></pre><pre>Alfanski, 1997 p 10. good governance became an IMF priority in 1990&#039;s</pre>etc. (<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/NotesPOLB90-2004.pdf"">here</a>are the actual notes I took for the essay back in 2004). This took a while, and was all manual - I copied the individual lines, and had to add the article they came from. But the advantage was that once I had gone through and classified all my notes like this, I then had my ""outline"", and could write my article, first writing about corruption, and quickly able to insert the relevant citations, then about good governance, etc.I remember fantasizing about creating a tool which would let me tag a text string with the property of being from a certain publication, and when I copied a part of that text to another place, that ""property"" would follow the text, kind of like how you mark a paragraph as blue, and when you copy a few words from that paragraph and put them somewhere else, those words stay blue. Little did I know that I would create a tool to essentially do that (although slightly differently), 8 years later.<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Using tags to move things around</span></strong><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/_media/ideas:visual026.png?cache="" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""322"" />The example of a workshop with sticky notes, and Knowledge Forum, are both examples of ""graphical interfaces"" where you can literally move ideas around, and organize knowledge spatially. I find these kind of interfaces very fascinating (although ironically, I don&#039;t regularly use any concept mapping, mind mapping or other graphical idea tool). However, for someone who likes hacking, one of the challenges for me is that it&#039;s much easier to write tools to process straight text, than it is to program a graphical interface.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-09.51.11.png""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1421 alignnone"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-06-13 at 09.51.11"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-09.51.11.png"" alt="""" width=""426"" height=""251"" /></a>I first had the idea of using tags to help us reorganize ideas, and make them ""fungible"" when thinking about <a href=""http://innovations.oise.utoronto.ca/edtech/index.php/Knowledge_eCommons_2.0"">Pepper</a> (formerly Knowledge eCommons), a discussion forum tool developed at OISE, and how we could more easily work with the ideas posted, and reorganize them (for example going back after five weeks of discussions, captured in five weekly forums, to extract all the posts about a certain topic into a new forum, to continue the discussion there). This <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/Tagging"">made me realize</a> that tags could be used in many different ways. If I tag a blog post immediately upon writing it, or a Flickr photo immediately upon uploading it, it&#039;s an example of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy"">folksonomy</a>. It doesn&#039;t use a controlled vocabulary, so there might be some photos tagged ""Istanbul"", some tagged ""Turkey"", some tagged ""Стамбул"" etc, and the person tagging also has to try to ""predict"" which words a future user will search for.Contrast this with for example tags on Twitter. Often times, these function more as channels (and indeed the # symbol comes from the channel prefix used on <a href=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC"">IRC</a>). If I tag something with <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23oa"">#oa</a>, I know that a number of people have saved searches for #oa because they are interested in Open Access. This becomes even more clear when you&#039;re attending a conference that has designated an official Twitter hashtag. In many ways, this is like a global ""category"", more than a folksonomy tag.So with regards to the discussion forum, my idea was not for people to try to predict what people were going to be searching for in the future, and tag messages immediately as they wrote them. Instead, people would revisit the group&#039;s writings after a certain period, and find certain emerging topics. They could then apply a tag to messages that they wanted to ""collect"", and a new saved search would automatically be created for this tag, where all messages could be seen together, and the discussion could continue.<img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/_media/ideas:visual005.png"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""322"" />In many ways, this concept of emerging ideas or categories reminds me of grounded qualitative analysis, when someone is coding a bunch of interviews, and reads them over and over again. He or she doesn&#039;t start out with set categories, but gradually certain trends emerge, and the different statements are sorted - whether by moving piles of cut-up text slips, or using some kind of qualitative research software.This is again quite similar to the process of doing a literature review. You start by identifying a large amount of articles in a specific field, and through reading them you start identifying certain trends or categories. Then you need to move and organize your notes according to these trends, before you can start writing the actual literature review article.<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Building the tool</span></strong>With all this in the back of my mind, I was working on a literature review of research on open courses (there have been many articles on Open Educational Resources, but very few on open learning interactions). I began finding and adding PDFs to <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start"">my system</a>, reading them and extracting highlights, adding high-level notes using <a title=""Using web clipping and sidewiki to gather and synthesize information"" href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2012/05/10/using-web-clipping-and-sidewiki-to-gather-and-synthesize-information/"">sidewiki</a>. But I was left with a long list of individual article notes - how to turn this into one document?On a hunch, I decided to try to use <a href=""http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper"">Taskpaper</a>, a text-based outliner, to take very brief notes from each paper (also capturing the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:citekeys"">citekey</a> as header). Part of the file ended up looking like this<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-10.46.59.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1423"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-06-13 at 10.46.59"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-10.46.59.png"" alt="""" width=""419"" height=""291"" /></a>Now I at least had all the notes in one file, as opposed to spread over forty wiki pages. But still, I had to do what I did when writing the political science article in 2004, copy and paste lines from each article to sort similar ideas together. I decided that if I could just tag lines with the name of the grouping, and have a script move the lines for me, that would speed the process up considerable. So I wrote <a href=""https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web/blob/master/tag-extract.rb"">tag-extract</a>.Taskpaper makes tagging even easier by automatically recognizing words after @ as tags, color coding them red, and enabling tag-completion based on the tags you&#039;ve already created.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-10.50.59.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1425"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-06-13 at 10.50.59"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-10.50.59.png"" alt="""" width=""429"" height=""289"" /></a>I further realized that given the structure of this text file, there were two things that the script could assume. The first was that every line below a cite key like [@weller2007distance] ""belonged"" to that citekey, so it could automatically append this citekey to tagged lines. Secondly, text indented below a line in a certain sense ""belongs"" to that line, so if that line gets tagged, all the text indented below should be included as well. In the example below, the entire list of theories will be copied to the section called ""theory"", but certain lines in the list will also be copied to other tags, like ""connectivism"" and ""andragogy"".<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-10.53.49.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1427"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-06-13 at 10.53.49"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-10.53.49.png"" alt="""" width=""400"" height=""99"" /></a>When it comes to output formats, I so far added three different output formats (although it would be easy to add other ways of formatting the text). The simplest one is a new indented text file, which can be read by Taskpaper or even a normal text editor.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-10.57.31.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1428"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-06-13 at 10.57.31"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-10.57.31.png"" alt="""" width=""426"" height=""333"" /></a>Above you see two tags from the output file, @soc_contract and @metalearning, underneath you see the lines tagged, and the citekeys they came from.

My favorite tool for authoring academic texts is <a href=""http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php"">Scrivener</a>, and I used it to write both my <a href=""https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/10319"">BA honors thesis</a> and <a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses"">my MA thesis</a>, as well as a number of articles. From my MA thesis, I even published <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/05/18/all-the-raw-notes-from-my-ma-thesis-chinese-national-top-level-courses/"">all the raw notes from Scrivener</a>. The great thing about Scrivener is that you can easily keep all your notes in the same document as your actual text, and view both the text for a section you are writing, and the notes for that section, in a split screen window. So I created an export format that generates a folder with one text file for each tag.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-11.09.54.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1432"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-06-13 at 11.09.54"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-11.09.54.png"" alt="""" width=""470"" height=""350"" /></a>This can then be dragged and dropped onto a Scrivener document.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-11.11.14.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1433"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-06-13 at 11.11.14"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-11.11.14.png"" alt="""" width=""470"" height=""364"" /></a>...and you can start writing. You&#039;ve got all your notes, separated into sections which corresponds to the sections you are going to be writing in the actual document, and you&#039;ve got the citekeys, which you can just insert directly into the draft. Here&#039;s an example of my writing the literature review.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-11.16.38.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1434"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-06-13 at 11.16.38"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-11.16.38.png"" alt="""" width=""470"" height=""390"" /></a>Once you are finished writing, you can export the Scrivener document back to Dokuwiki, which formats it nicely and renders all the citekeys as proper citations (you can see the <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/Draft%20Literature%20Review%20Open%20Courses"">current, very early draft</a>)<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-11.18.50.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1435"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-06-13 at 11.18.50"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-11.18.50.png"" alt="""" width=""470"" height=""276"" /></a>...with an automatically generated bibliography...<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-11.19.06.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1436"" title=""Screen Shot 2012-06-13 at 11.19.06"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-13-at-11.19.06.png"" alt="""" width=""470"" height=""116"" /></a>All in all, a very neat workflow. The <a href=""https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web/blob/master/tag-extract.rb"">script itself</a>is not very advanced (although it still took me a bit of fiddling to get it all to work), but I really like the way it lets me work. It&#039;s fairly decoupled from researchr, so it should be quite easy to get it to work for others as well (note, it requires Ruby 1.9.1 because of the way I did the regexps).I made two screencasts to show how this works, the first is a brief five minutes, and shows the basic functionality of the tagging with two examples, one a literature review, and the second coding interviews (given my thoughts of how this overlaps with qualitative research - although I&#039;m not claiming that this is a competitor to ATLAS.ti exactly)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEfdPDptD5UThe second is a longer 18 minutes, and goes through the entire process of creating a literature review, starting with extracting information from articles, and ending with publishing it back to the wiki. It showcases much of the functionality of researchr, but with a much more task-specific focus than <a href=""https://vimeo.com/25295002"">my first screencast</a>, almost a year ago.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OevO1hXPoUStian","Stian Haklev => About tag-extract, I was thinking about making a simple website where you could upload a text-file, and have it ""tag-extracted"", since many of my friends aren&#039;t comfortable with command line tools, etc. Never got that far though. Even lazily asked StackOverflow for an easy way to do it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14380244/is-there-a-template-for-a-website-that-accepts-an-uploaded-file-does-something :). Good luck with your experimentation, and check out for example http://www.organognosi.com/, one of the sites that really inspired me - he does magic with DevonThink, external application URLs, and AppleScript.. Jose => Thanks, Stian, I had overlooked that. It&#039;s working now and it&#039;s mazing!I have found great tips in your site to organize my workflow. I was using calibre with a not so polished script <a href=""http://www.tonymcdaniel.com/2011/09/writing-calibre-tags-to-openmeta.html?showComment=1352753821153#c1550974388733237895"" rel=""nofollow"">script</a> to transfer its tags to openmeta. However, that isn&#039;t more than a poor transfer from the physical classification capabilities of a library to the digital environment.Being able to classify parts of the text is an advancement. I will put it in practice now to see how it fits my needs. Skim highlights can be tagged on the go, but I don&#039;t know of any apps able to do that in iPad, iPhone or the Sony ereader I use.I am now trying to decide if pairing tag-extract with TextWrangler + taskpaper-bbedit, OmniOutliner (+OmniFocus) or TaskPaper. I think the unique feature to select tags in the latter will be useful.I will also check if DevonThink can make anything useful out of these shorter texts. I tried it before but in my opinion it wasn&#039;t of any use with the full pdfs.Thanks again.. Stian Haklev => Hi Jose,that is because it unfortunately requires Ruby 1.9*. It would be possible to rewrite the regexp sequence to be compatible with Ruby 1.8, but I spent enough time getting it to work at all, so I&#039;ll leave that to others. Stian. Jose => Your work is very interesing, thanks for sharing. When executing tag-extract, downloaded from github, I get tag-extract.rb:70: undefined (?...) sequence: /\B # non-word marker(?&lt;!\[) # not preceded by [ (to avoid catching publication references like [@publication])\@(?.+?) # word starting with @\b # word boundary/Thanks for your help.

Stian Haklev => Thank you for your suggestion. I have indeed experimented with Tinderbox, and I found it very interesting, I was quite inspired by some of the metaphors, and also the book by Mark Bernstein. However, I ended up not working with it. One problem was that I found it hard to integrate with other tools because it does not support AppleScript.. Jean => Try Tinderbox!  It will allow you to view/manipulate your notes in both outline and ""mindmap"" forms, and it now has a pretty effortless export to Scrivener. Plus a bunch of other features.. Temi Ladenika => I have come across your article during an international conference on research methodologies. I was doing a search to find ways of identifying particular words and phrases to determine the existence of aspects of a model I am developing for independent learning. I find your description on how to use tags to extract data very intriguing. However I must say I have got lost with the programming terms. I there any way  tag extract can be explained to someone outside the field of programming?. Stian Haklev => Now I just need to do some quality academic writing :). Nate Otto => Great! At this point, you&#039;re probably one of the planet&#039;s top-tier researcher of academic writing workflows. :).

These design approaches include: human-centred and participatory design; inclusive design of information technology; distributed information and knowledge building; free and open software and hardware; sensemaking; materialization, visualization and many other related concepts.</blockquote>We are using <a href=""http://1001.kmdi.utoronto.ca"">a course blog</a>, both to communicate with the students, and share lecture slides and material, and also for the students to post their own material and reflections. This WordPress blog is both much easier for us to use than the institutional BlackBoard, and it also has the advantage that all the material is open to the world - and there are some great resources there, which you should check out.You can start by getting <a href=""http://1001.kmdi.utoronto.ca/?p=13"">an intro to the concepts of Knowledge Media Design</a> from the first lecture, and look at <a href=""http://1001.kmdi.utoronto.ca/?p=21"">the sticky notes</a> from our brainstorming in that session.

In<strong><em>What It Means to be an Open Scholar, and the Future of Scholarly Publishing,</em></strong><em></em>I tried to go beyond the traditional ""green and gold OA, put your publications on the institutional repository, etc"", and look at expanding the definition - publishing in many different formats and channels, and sharing data and notes during the research process.</div><div style=""margin-bottom: 5px;"">I was inspired by a quote by Gideon Burton about <a href=""http://www.academicevolution.com/2009/08/the-open-scholar.html"">the<strong>open scholar</strong></a>:</div><blockquote><div style=""margin-bottom: 5px;"">The Open Scholar, as I&#039;m defining this person, is not simply someone who agrees to allow free access and reuse of his or her traditional scholarly articles and books; no,the Open Scholar is someone whomakes their intellectual projects and processes digitally visibleand who invites and encourages ongoing criticism of their work and secondary uses of any or all parts of it--at any stage of its development.</div></blockquote><div style=""margin-bottom: 5px;"">I began by talking about my own experiments with publishing and disseminating <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/09/20/mencerdaskan-bangsa-an-inquiry-into-the-phenomenon-of-taman-bacaan-in-indonesia/"">my BA</a> and <a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2012/02/08/results-of-a-1-5-year-academic-publishing-experiment/"">MA thesis in a variety of formats</a>, and then discussed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science"">the open notebook science movement</a>, <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/Individual%20Academic%20Wikis"">PhD wikis</a>, and ended with some ideas on the future of semantic publishing, inspired by ia. <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/anitawaard"">Anita de Waard</a>.

The final presentation was probably quite scattered, but I think had a lot of interesting ideas.

"Integrating iPhone photography with wiki for note-taking during conference,"academia/research,open access,Researchr,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2013/01/25/integrating-iphone-photography-with-wiki-for-note-taking-during-conference/,"<strong>Developing Researchr - two converging strands</strong>The development of <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start"">Researchr</a>, the open academic workflow, began from two different angles. I began thinking about highlighting text, and extracting those highlights, and then doing something about them, because I got my first Kindle (the Keyboard one). It enabled quick highlighting, and all the highlighted text was copied into a file called My Clippings.txt, which could be accessed through the USB channel (clippings for books bought at Amazon are also available through a web interface).I ended up transferring lots of academic articles to my Kindle, and taking hundreds of clippings, and then wondering about what I should do with these. I discovered <a href=""http://appscript.sourceforge.net/rb-appscript/"">rb-appscript</a>, which enabled me to remote control other Mac applications through Ruby, and initially began by importing the clippings into <a href=""http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html"">DevonThink</a>. I then began thinking about ways of publishing my clippings online, and wrote some scripts that turned DevonThink (and later Scrivener) exports into browseable web pages, and used this to publish <a title=""All the raw notes from my MA thesis: Chinese National Top Level Courses"" href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/05/18/all-the-raw-notes-from-my-ma-thesis-chinese-national-top-level-courses/"">all the notes from my MA thesis</a>.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/top-level-courses/scrivener-web/""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-1513"" alt=""Screen Shot 2013-01-25 at 20.10.20"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-20.10.20.png"" width=""450"" height=""229"" /></a>At the same time, I was interested in a tool to let me take notes during conferences, and I stumbled upon DokuWiki. I had used it before, and loved the idea that it didn&#039;t rely on a database server, rather storing all the pages in simple text files with wiki markup. This meant that I could simply use rsync to mirror online a version of the wiki, while hosting the main version on my own computer (crucial for use during conferences, with poor connectivity). I <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/aera11:start"">used this the first time</a> during AERA in New Orleans in 2011, and since then I&#039;ve used it during a number of <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/conferences"">conferences</a>.After I came home, I realised that I could also take notes and extract them into text format from <a href=""http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/"">Skim</a>, that I could import these to DokuWiki, instead of to DevonThink, and I began experimenting with BibDesk, and automatically generating citation data using the amazing <a href=""https://github.com/inukshuk/bibtex-ruby"">bibtex-ruby</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/inukshuk/citeproc-ruby"">citeproc-ruby</a> libraries. From there, there was no way back :)<strong>Adding images to wikis</strong>I eventually developed a very efficient way of importing text to the wiki, whether it be clippings or my own notes when reading PDFs or Kindle documents, clippings from other websites, etc. However, there was no easy way to bring pictures into the wiki, and whenever I came across a great illustration, a graph or a diagram in an article, I thought that my corresponding notes would be the poorer for not including this. Traditionally, it has been a bit of a hassle including graphics in wikis, because they have been treated as their own elements. On Wikipedia, for example, you typically go to Wikimedia to upload a media file, specifying copyright information, description, etc, and then you use a code to embed it in your wiki page. While important for a big public wiki, this was a lot more cumbersome than I wanted.There were two problems: Getting a picture out of a PDF, and into the wiki. The first problem had several solutions. I thought about drawing a square on the page, and then letting the export process get the coordinates, and try to extract the picture from those coordinates in the PDF. This might be possible (and might be an even more elegant solution in the long run), but I never got that far. I fell back on a built-in functionality in OSX that I love: partial screenshots. Shift+Cmd+3 takes a screenshot of the whole screen, and Shift+Cmd+4 let&#039;s you select a portion of the screen. Crucially, it doesn&#039;t ask you where to put them, but simply names them in a consistent manner, and dumps them into your Desktop folder.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-19.32.571.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1502"" alt=""Screen Shot 2013-01-25 at 19.32.57"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-19.32.571.png"" width=""470"" height=""267"" /></a>&nbsp;So I developed the following workflow for grabbing photos from PDFs. While reading along, highlighting and commenting, I could grab a picture at anytime using Shift+Cmd+3. After grabbing the screenshot, I also had to press Ctrl+Alt+Cmd+C, which would simply add a line to a cache file noting the page location I was on, and the name of the most recent screenshot in the Desktop folder.Then, when exporting to the wiki, it would read the cache file, move each file into the correct wiki folder, and insert the corresponding wiki image link into the article page. It works great, and if you look at my <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/bib:bibliography"">Bibliography</a>, all the articles with an I have images, which are placed at the bottom of the page (<a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/ref:bergstrom2011encouraging#images"">example</a>).With this, it was a simple next step to add a keyboard shortcut to wiki editing, Ctrl+Alt+Cmd+C when editing a wiki page moves the most recent screenshot into the wiki, and inserts a wiki link at the cursor. I use this frequently when for example editing <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/a:start"">author pages</a> (<a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/a:gerry_stahl"">example</a>).<strong>Using the iPhone to insert photos live during conferences</strong><a href=""http://bodongchen.com/"">Bodong</a> is another PhD student at OISE. He is currently using <a href=""http://bodongchen.com/wiki/"">a version of Researchr</a> on a PC, but during ICLS 2012 in Sydney, he chose to <a href=""https://www.evernote.com/pub/dirkchen/icls2012"">take notes using the Evernote app on his iPad</a>. I&#039;ve never quite understood people who are able to type that confidently on a touch-screen, but one thing that really impressed me was that he could type some text, raise the iPad and take a photo of the speakers, or slides, the photo would be inserted exactly where the cursor was, and he could continue to type.<a href=""https://www.evernote.com/pub/dirkchen/icls2012""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-1511"" alt=""Screen Shot 2013-01-25 at 20.07.40"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-20.07.40.png"" width=""450"" height=""259"" /></a>I recently got an iPhone and have been using it to take a lot more photos than I used to. With the new <a href=""http://www.apple.com/ca/icloud/features/photo-stream.html"">PhotoStream</a>pictures you take automatically arrive on your other devices, without needing to plug in or sync, making it much easier. This made me think that it might be possible to integrate iPhone photos into note taking in DokuWiki. Apple just wants you to access your PhotoStream from within iPhoto, but since it&#039;s so tightly integrated with the operating system, you don&#039;t need to have iPhoto open for the photos to be downloaded, they are stored in the folder ~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub.And once you have the photos on computer, it is as easy to insert them into a wiki page as inserting a recent screenshot. However, the problem was knowing when a new photo had arrived - it&#039;s fairly fast but not simultaneous (some experimentation showed that I had to exit the photo app before the photos are uploaded). Since the insert command automatically moves and renames the photos, executing it when the photo you want has not arrived yet, will move and link in an old photo, which is not what we want.I solved this in two ways. One was by adding a ""preview"" function, which uses qlpreview (similar to pressing space over a file in Finder) to show which file will be insert when you give the insert command. The second was to write a little <a href=""https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web/blob/master/watch_photostream.rb"">""photostream-watch"" script</a>, which watches the director, and posts a growl with a little icon of the photo, whenever a new photo is downloaded from Photostream.<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/newphoto.png""><img class="" wp-image-1510 alignnone"" alt=""newphoto"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/newphoto.png"" width=""299"" height=""60"" /></a>(I also use <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/sips.1.html"">sips</a>to resize the photos, since they usually arrive as 2-3MB files. I also need to rotate them if the metadata indicates a need (ie. you held the iPhone in the wrong direction), but I haven&#039;t figured this out yet).<strong>It works</strong><a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/media_pedagogy_panel""><img class=""alignleft  wp-image-1507"" alt=""Long wiki page"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Long-wiki-page.png"" width=""175"" height=""547"" /></a>In the end, I got it all working, and I showed it to some friends as a very neat hack. It wasn&#039;t until yesterday that I finally had a chance to try it out. I attended a critical media education panel, and used DokuWiki to take notes. I started the watcher, and shot a few pictures of the whole panel, and later of the individual panel members. You can see the result <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/media_pedagogy_panel"">here</a>.I&#039;m pretty excited by this, even though it&#039;s still not perfect. I think it makes the notes look much more inviting, and it&#039;s neat to remember how people looked. I was sitting fairly far towards the front, but I didn&#039;t seem to be able to focus on the slides well enough to get a good resolution picture (many of the presenters didn&#039;t even use slides, so I didn&#039;t try too hard).The pictures of the individual presenters are also quite blurry - these were done with digital zoom on the iPhone (it might have been better if I had cropped on my computer, but the idea was trying to make it as quick a workflow as possible - have the photo go straight into the wiki, with no fuzzing on the computer).I had to flip a few pictures manually in Preview, so I should really figure out how to change the orientation (pictures with the orientation metadata bit set look ok in preview, but not when viewed in a web browser. If you save them in Preview, Preview will manually rotate them into the proper orientation).Since this is based on PhotoStream, it can only be used with Apple devices, but it should be trivial to modify the solution to work with for example DropBox, if there are any good Android photo apps which immediately sync to DropBox.Stian","Making Open Access articles much more visible, automatically","academia/research,open access,Researchr,tech,",http://reganmian.net/blog/2013/01/25/making-open-access-articles-much-more-visible-automaticall/,"<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/OA-padlock_oaig-pic11.jpg""><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-1546"" style=""margin: 7px;"" alt=""OA-padlock_oaig-pic1"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/OA-padlock_oaig-pic11.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""133"" /></a>In April, <a title=""API to check if a publication is &ldquo;Open Access&rdquo;"" href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2012/04/17/api-to-check-if-a-publication-is-open-access/"">I wrote about</a> my desire to make OA publications much more visible on <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/"">my academic wiki</a>, and whenever I cite them. The first challenge was to capture the URL I downloaded the files from (ideally automatically), and then check if it is ""truly"" OA, and not just available to me because I am using the university network. (Yes, I&#039;d love for all articles to be formally OA, using a CC license etc, but for now, I&#039;m more than happy to see articles available for download to the world!)<strong>Improving the API</strong>So I figured out a way to get the URL from the file metadata, and created a simple API to check if the file was indeed a PDF, and available to the world. I then store this information in the bibtex metadata using the field oa-url and url (the url field is used by other software, but there is no guarantee that it points to a PDF, or that it&#039;s OA).Since then, I&#039;ve upgraded the API to become much more robust (<a href=""https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web/blob/master/check-oa.rb"">the new code</a> is slightly longer, but performs much better). It uses curl instead of the built-in functionality in Ruby, because curl seems better at following redirects, etc. It first tries to grab the header to check if it&#039;s the correct MIME type. If that fails, it tries to download the whole file, and uses the <em>file</em> command to see if it&#039;s a PDF file.I also <a href=""https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web/blob/master/update_urls.rb"">created a script</a> that goes through every single already-downloaded file and checks this from the local computer (make sure to execute this outside of a campus network) - I&#039;m running the API on my own server, so I&#039;d preferred not to be spammed with thousands of requests simultaneously.<strong>Showing it off</strong>Once I have this data, how do I represent it? Initially, all it did was add a simple ""Downloaded from"" in the citation, but I always wanted to ""celebrate"" the fact that a publication was publicly available. I redesigned the citation header (also hiding some of the internal links that aren&#039;t useful to web visitors). Here&#039;s how <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/ref:bergstrom2011encouraging"">an OA publication</a> looks when you are logged in (<em>BibDesk</em> opens the publication in BibDesk, <em>Skim</em> opens the PDF in Skim, and<em>Sidewiki</em> opens the <a title=""Using web clipping and sidewiki to gather and synthesize information"" href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2012/05/10/using-web-clipping-and-sidewiki-to-gather-and-synthesize-information/"">side-by-side view)</a>:<a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/ref:bergstrom2011encouraging""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1536"" alt=""Screen Shot 2013-01-25 at 23.15.49"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-23.15.49.png"" width=""450"" height=""46"" /></a>and here is how it looks on the public web:<a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/ref:bergstrom2011encouraging""><img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-1537"" alt=""Screen Shot 2013-01-25 at 23.16.11"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-23.16.11.png"" width=""450"" height=""40"" /></a>(I have not inserted any tracking code, so I have no way of knowing how many people actually click these buttons and download the PDFs, although it would be interesting.)Of course, it doesn&#039;t stop with the actual publication page. One of the goals with Researchr is that you should be able to use a publication&#039;s<a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:citekeys"">citekey</a> (like scardamalia1999research) anywhere on the wiki, on your blog, or even in authoring a publication, and have the proper citation generated. So if you go to the bibliography, you can immediately see which publications are OA (and download them directly through the icon):<a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/bib:bibliography""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1538"" alt=""Screen Shot 2013-01-25 at 23.22.01"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-23.22.01.png"" width=""450"" height=""265"" /></a>similarly on an author page:<a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/a:simon_buckingham_shum""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1539"" alt=""Screen Shot 2013-01-25 at 23.23.14"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-23.23.14.png"" width=""450"" height=""293"" /></a>And anywhere on the wiki where you are citing an article, for example this extract from my (very in-progress) <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/draft_literature_review_open_courses"">draft of a literature review on open courses</a>(<a title=""tag-extract: A tool to automatically restructure text/outline using tags"" href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/2012/06/13/tag-extract-a-tool-to-automatically-restructure-textoutline-using-tags/"">blog about the process of writing this literature review</a>):<a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/draft_literature_review_open_courses""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1540"" alt=""Screen Shot 2013-01-25 at 23.26.00"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-23.26.00.png"" width=""450"" height=""328"" /></a><span style=""color: #3366ff;"">As with any citation, hovering over the link shows you the full citation:</span><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hovering.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1541"" alt=""hovering"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hovering.png"" width=""450"" height=""158"" /></a>andclicking on the link brings you to my article page with the full citation, download link, clippings, my high level notes, etc. (For example <a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/ref:couros2010developing"">Couros, 2010</a>). Clicking on the PDF icon directly downloads the PDF to your computer. And here is how the section above looks like in the edit view, as you see all the citations are simply using the citekeys, and you get everything else for free:<a href=""http://reganmian.net/wiki/draft_literature_review_open_courses?do=edit&amp;rev=1350082780""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1551 alignnone"" alt=""Screen Shot 2013-01-25 at 23.31.19"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-23.31.191.png"" width=""450"" height=""355"" /></a>Note that this is all dynamic, so if I in the future found an open version of the Fini article mentioned above, and added this metadata to BibDesk, this page would have a PDF icon next to Fini on the next reload (the same with the Fini article page, etc).This doesn&#039;t only work on the wiki; I also created a WordPress plugin which enables me to use the same citekey syntax in my blog, and type for example:<pre>&#91;@couros2010developing] is a very interesting article about open teaching.</pre>And it turns into:[@couros2010developing] is a very interesting article about open teaching.<strong>Future work</strong>It&#039;s very frustrating to see how little useful metadata and open APIs are available. There doesn&#039;t seem to be a clear standard for embedding microdata into websites with bibliographic metadata, and some of the standards used. <a href=""http://www.zotero.org"">Zotero</a>, which is dependent on publishers making metadata available, <a href=""http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/exposing_metadata"">talks about</a>RDF, COinS and unAPI, none of which are easy for me to generate (if you have a Ruby or Javascript library which can generate either of the above from BibTex, let me know). I use a hidden tag to expose the BibTeX entry on articlepages:<img class="" wp-image-1553 alignnone"" alt=""Screen Shot 2013-01-25 at 23.49.29"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-23.49.29.png"" width=""450"" height=""349"" />This enables me to do things like automatically grab and import the citation from another user&#039;s Researchr wiki into my own BibDesk (and if there is a URL, try to download the PDF and attach it automatically), and if you click on the page number after a PDF clipping, it automatically attempts to download the PDF from the publishers (or repository), and opens it in the PDF browser, on the page specified:<a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-23.56.28.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1555"" alt=""Screen Shot 2013-01-25 at 23.56.28"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-23.56.28.png"" width=""450"" height=""59"" /></a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/growl.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1556"" alt=""growl"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/growl.png"" width=""299"" height=""48"" /></a><a href=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skim2.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1558"" alt=""skim2"" src=""http://reganmian.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skim2.png"" width=""446"" height=""189"" /></a>&nbsp;(I made <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5LgG_K3y8A"">a screencast</a> showing this off).My point is that this should be much more universal - I wish that every site published machine-readable metadata that let me automatically import it to whatever citation manager I use, together with the PDF (if the PDF is available). I wish the BibTex metadata would contain the URL to download the PDF, and even information of whether a publication is OA or not, what kind of license it has, etc.But for now, I&#039;m very happy with showcasing all the great OA articles that are linked from my site.
